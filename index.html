[00:00.00]华研外语：www.TopwayEnglish.com
[00:15.19]College English Test Band 4
[00:18.44]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:22.95]Section A
[00:24.65]Directions: In this section, you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.85]At the end of each news report,
[00:31.85]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:34.30]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:38.95]After you hear a question,
[00:41.40]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:44.11]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:47.58]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:51.08]with a single line through the centre.
[00:54.33]News Report One
[00:57.43]A new study on climate change
[01:00.23]says a disastrous 4-degree rise in global temperature
[01:04.79]is increasingly likely to occur within many people's lifetimes.
[01:09.94]The studies have been adopted
[01:11.94]by one of the world's leading research bodies
[01:14.85]monitoring climate change, the Hadley Centre in Britain.
[01:19.20]This latest prediction from the Hadley Centre
[01:22.51]brings the prospect of destructive change much closer.
[01:26.77]He challenges the assumption that severe warming
[01:30.38]is a threat only for future generations.
[01:33.83]A 4-degree average temperature rise by the 2050s
[01:38.30]would bring increases of 10 degrees or more
[01:42.21]in some areas such as the Arctic and Africa.
[01:46.06]It could mean a sharp decline in rainfall in some areas,
[01:50.22]flooding in others and disappearance of about
[01:53.42]half of all the world's animal and plant species.
[01:57.63]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[02:03.88]1. How many degrees are expected to rise globally by the 2050s?
[02:24.95]2. What is the result of the temperature rise by the 2050s?
[02:47.16]News Report Two
[02:49.41]As many as a million Cubans are said to have attended the free concert
[02:54.02]in Havana's revolution square
[02:55.92]that featured some of the Latin America's most popular musicians.
[03:00.03]Many in the crowd came dress in white to symbolize peace.
[03:04.48]The 5-hour event included the bands from seven countries,
[03:08.48]it was organized by the Miami base Colombian rock star Wallace.
[03:13.92]"This concert is just about peace, is just about possibility to get together,
[03:19.28]you know, through music, through art.
[03:22.13]And this particular case of Cuba have isolated
[03:25.44]from the rest of community for many years,
[03:27.85]just because of political belief.
[03:30.23]So we just want to come here and saying well,
[03:33.34]we are here, we are the same.
[03:36.19]So that is the reason why we are here to promote peace."
[03:40.74]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[03:46.74]3. What is the theme of the concert?
[04:06.60]4. What can we learn about the concert?
[04:25.77]News Report Three 
[04:29.02]Crude oil is measured in barrels.
[04:31.57]Last summer, its global price was $100 per barrel.
[04:36.82]Yesterday, it was trading at less than half of that, at about $46.50 a barrel.
[04:44.77]Why does that matter?
[04:46.47]Well, the price of crude affects everything
[04:49.58]from gas prices to car prices, to stock prices.
[04:53.33]And it determines the number of jobs in the large global oil industry.
[04:58.73]The current surplus of oil gives us a clear lesson
[05:02.74]in the economic principle of supply and demand.
[05:06.09]When it comes to oil, it used to be all about the Middle East.
[05:10.84]Today, the Persian Gulf still has plenty of crude, but the boom is global.
[05:16.99]We produced a surplus of 2 million to 3 million barrels per day.
[05:22.54]Oil buried deep beneath the earth surface in rock
[05:26.39]can now be accessed with new technologies
[05:29.29]like fracking and horizontal drilling.
[05:32.10]Two years ago, U.S. oil production
[05:35.35]saw its biggest jump in more than 100 years,
[05:39.16]and it's not the only country to gain a large flood of crude.
[05:43.43]Production in Canada and Brazil has also hit record levels.
[05:48.14]At the same time, there are more alternatives to oil,
[05:52.60]like natural gas and renewables.
[05:55.40]When oil supply exceeds demand, prices fall.
[06:00.00]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[06:05.26]5. What happened to oil price?
[06:25.10]6. What caused the change of oil price?
[06:44.09]7. Why does oil production increase dramatically?
[07:04.10]Section B
[07:05.57]Directions: In this section, you will hear two long conversations.
[07:10.37]At the end of each conversation, you will hear four questions.
[07:14.47]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[07:19.32]After you hear a question,
[07:20.98]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[07:24.38]marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:28.50]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:32.05]with a single line through the centre.
[07:35.31]Conversation One
[07:37.81]M: Good afternoon, ma'am.
[07:40.17]I'm Mr. Smith.
[07:42.38]I called you a little while ago about the apartment for rent.
[07:47.23]W: Oh, right, Mr. Smith. Come in.
[07:51.59]Let me show you the place.
[07:54.09]The two rooms are upstairs.
[07:57.30]Come with me.
[07:58.95]M: You have a very nice house.
[08:02.16]W: Thanks. Here we are.
[08:05.31]Both are simply furnished with a bed,
[08:08.11]a desk and a cupboard.
[08:10.56]M: This is not bad. How's the hot water?
[08:15.02]That's very important.
[08:17.27]I'm asking because where I live now
[08:20.24]keeps running out of hot water.
[08:22.89]I can't tell you how many cold showers I've had to take.
[08:27.60]In fact, I had to take one just this morning.
[08:32.71]I can't stand taking cold showers any more.
[08:37.06]W: Don't worry.
[08:39.11]You can shower to your heart's content in here.
[08:42.26]M: How much is the rent?
[08:44.81]W: Well, how about $250 a month for each room?
[08:50.93]That includes water, electricity and gas.
[08:55.54]M: Well, that sounds quite reasonable.
[08:59.44]Did you say quite a few people are waiting for these two rooms?
[09:04.54]W: Right. But you have no children.
[09:08.19]I'd like to put you up higher on the list.
[09:11.04]M: Well, thank you very much.
[09:14.39]I'll consult with my wife and contact you
[09:18.19]as soon as we make up our minds.
[09:21.50]It's really very nice talking with you.
[09:24.10]W: Thank you. I'm glad you like the rooms.
[09:28.25]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:35.22]8. What are the two speakers talking about?
[09:55.75]9. Which of the following does the man pay more attention to?
[10:16.66]10. How much will the man pay each month for the two rooms?
[10:38.95]11. Why would the woman like to rent these two rooms to the man?
[11:00.81]Conversation Two
[11:03.66]W: Where did you go on May Day?
[11:05.41]I called you several times.
[11:07.76]M: Really? I have my holiday on a seaside resort.
[11:11.12]W: Wow, that's terrific. Did you travel alone?
[11:13.89]M: No, my wife and son also traveled with me.
[11:17.74]Where did you go then?
[11:19.45]W: I went nowhere. I spent the whole holiday writing.
[11:22.61]I have to finish it before Mother's Day.
[11:25.07]But I do plan to travel next month,
[11:27.62]that's why I'm calling you.
[11:28.92]Could you give me some advice?
[11:30.67]M: Oh, how about the seaside?
[11:33.17]That's a really good place for a holiday.
[11:35.98]W: Sounds good.
[11:37.27]M: There are two hotels I can recommend while you are on your trip.
[11:41.13]They are both brand new and are usually fully booked.
[11:44.94]So you'd better call them in advance.
[11:47.34]W: I see... so what are they like?
[11:50.06]M: Well, one is called the Hotel Bay View.
[11:54.06]It's on the coast.
[11:55.31]So, it is very quiet and peaceful without noise pollution.
[12:00.42]And the rooms are of standard size
[12:02.92]and they all have a nice little balcony,
[12:04.74]where you can overlook the ocean.
[12:06.69]W: That's great!
[12:07.99]I need to have a tranquil period to relax.
[12:10.55]How about the other?
[12:11.75]M: The other is a city center hotel.
[12:14.10]Of course, there are no views of the sea
[12:17.15]and it tends to be a bit noisy and busy.
[12:19.30]But it is very convenient for you to go anywhere from the hotel.
[12:23.16]W: Er, it's useless for me.
[12:25.53]I don't want to go shopping or do anything like that.
[12:28.18]What about the price?
[12:29.64]M: Well, the Central Hotel is quite a bit more expensive.
[12:34.00]W: I know, thanks for your suggestion.
[12:37.05]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:43.26]12. What did the man do on May Day?
[13:04.78]13. Why does the woman call the man?
[13:24.88]14. What should the woman do if she is to stay where the man recommends?
[13:47.09]15. Which of the following environments will the woman probably choose?
[14:09.89]Section C
[14:11.24]Directions: In this section, you will hear three passages.
[14:15.26]At the end of each passage,
[14:17.26]you will hear three or four questions.
[14:20.17]Both the passage and the questions
[14:22.47]will be spoken only once.
[14:24.82]After you hear a question,
[14:26.87]you must choose the best answer
[14:28.92]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:33.37]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:37.37]with a single line through the centre.
[14:40.40]Passage One
[14:42.40]In the eyes of many people,
[14:43.93]city life is attractive with all its advantages and convenience,
[14:48.58]yet they don't see the other side of the picture.
[14:51.64]First, with the expansion of the city,
[14:54.35]housing has become a serious problem for city people.
[14:58.05]Then there is the problem of pollution.
[15:00.45]Harmful gases from vehicles and poisonous water from factories
[15:04.71]pollute our surroundings, and noise continually disturbs your peace
[15:09.62]and rest and drives you mad.
[15:11.62]Thirdly, modern city life puts a high pressure upon people,
[15:16.43]you have to hurry to bump into the flood of people,
[15:20.21]bicycles, cars, buses... All day long you are under great stress.
[15:26.87]Fourthly, big cities also cause some social problems,
[15:30.97]of which high crime rate is the most serious one.
[15:34.23]People are justifiably in fear of becoming victims of burglaries,
[15:39.54]robbery, murder and other crimes at any time.
[15:43.69]The city should find some way or other to cope with all these problems.
[15:48.64]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:53.89]16. What may drive city people mad, according to the passage?
[16:16.16]17. What are city people constantly in fear of?
[16:36.96]18. What is this passage mainly about?
[16:57.40]Passage Two
[16:59.55]Man has always been fascinated by dreams.
[17:02.36]He has always tried to find explanations for his dreams.
[17:06.57]Perhaps dreams tell us about the future or the past;
[17:10.24]perhaps they tell us about our deepest fears and hopes.
[17:13.90]I'll give you one or two facts about dreams.
[17:16.60]First of all, everyone dreams. You often hear people say,
[17:20.75]"I never dream" when they mean
[17:23.60]"I can never remember my dreams."
[17:26.12]When we dream, our eyes move rapidly in our sleep
[17:29.32]as if we were watching a moving picture,
[17:31.82]following it with our eyes. This movement is called REM,
[17:36.78]which is Rapid Eye Movement. REM sleep is the sleep that matters.
[17:42.89]Experiments have proved
[17:44.55]that if we wake people up throughout the night during REM,
[17:48.51]they will feel exhausted the next day.
[17:51.47]But they won't feel tired at all if we wake them up at times
[17:54.92]when they're not dreaming.
[17:56.37]So it is clear that it is dreaming that really refreshes us,
[18:00.59]not just the sleep.
[18:02.90]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:07.85]19. Why has man been so fascinated by dreams?
[18:29.93]20. What does REM mean?
[18:50.21]21. What have the experiments proved about dreams?
[19:10.68]Passage Three
[19:12.08]Are you familiar with large supermarkets?
[19:15.28]If so, then you probably know
[19:17.91]that almost everything in the market is in a container.
[19:21.67]Most food is in containers.
[19:23.97]Even fresh meat is sold in plastic packages.
[19:27.57]Fresh fruit and vegetables are usually the only food items
[19:31.72]that don't come in containers.
[19:33.57]In fact, almost everything at the supermarket is in a bag,
[19:37.87]a box, a bottle, a jar, a carton, or a can.
[19:42.77]This kind of packaging system is necessary at large supermarkets.
[19:47.37]Supermarkets buy large quantities of everything.
[19:50.58]Products must be protected during shipment
[19:53.42]and they must sit on the shelves for long periods of time.
[19:57.38]Containers, therefore, protect the products.
[20:01.58]Containers have another function, too.
[20:04.13]They give information about each product
[20:07.13]---names, weights, materials, and ingredients,
[20:11.89]and sometimes pictures of the products.
[20:14.24]This information is printed on labels or directly on the containers.
[20:19.30]But think of this, we never see most of the things
[20:23.42]we buy at the supermarket until we get home and open the containers.
[20:28.17]When we go shopping, we look at the labels on the containers.
[20:32.27]If the container is made of glass or clear plastic,
[20:36.17]perhaps we could see a little bit of the product.
[20:39.27]But usually containers completely hide their products.
[20:43.03]Shoppers must trust the labels.
[20:46.39]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:52.04]22. Which of the following is usually not sold 
[20:58.42]in containers at large supermarkets?
[21:16.47]23. What are the functions of containers?
[21:36.90]24. Which of the following doesn't need to be printed on labels?
[21:58.98]25. Why must shoppers trust labels?
[22:19.33]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

[00:18.48]College English Test Band 4
[00:21.94]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:26.09]Section A
[00:28.69]Directions: In this section, you will hear three news reports.
[00:34.70]At the end of each news report,
[00:36.90]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:39.02]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:44.00]After you hear a question,
[00:46.22]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:49.20]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:52.71]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:56.17]with a single line through the centre.
[00:59.53]News Report One
[01:02.86]Research into the icecap of North Pole
[01:07.01]has found that it is melting so quickly
[01:09.94]that the Arctic Ocean could lose most of its ice
[01:13.45]during summer time in as little as ten years.
[01:17.13]Scientists of Cambridge University
[01:20.08]say recent exploration to the Arctic led by explorer Pen Hadow
[01:25.21]found ice was much thinner than expected and less dense,
[01:30.23]subject to rapid melting.
[01:32.75]Mr. Hadow said the finding should act as a wake-up call.
[01:36.37]The long-term view for the global community,
[01:39.77]this is definitely not good news.
[01:42.78]But if we can see this for what it is which is the biggest visual cue
[01:48.09]that we are going to get to manage our relationship
[01:51.09]with the planet better, then that is a good thing.
[01:55.18]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[02:01.61]1. What is this news item mainly about?
[02:20.90]2. How can the bad news become a good one?
[02:40.37]News Report Two
[02:42.23]Fifty-seven "militiamen",
[02:44.46]including several high-ranking officers
[02:46.93]loyal to militia leader Gabriel Tang, were killed
[02:50.29]when Tang's forces attacked the Sudan People's Liberation Army
[02:54.61]in Southern Sudan, officials said Sunday.
[02:57.42]Tang's forces launched the attack at Kaldak on Saturday,
[03:02.07]the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA)
[03:05.51]said in a statement issued
[03:07.38]on behalf of General Malaak Ayuen of the South Sudan Army.
[03:11.88]The SPLA is the military wing of the movement
[03:15.90]that governs Southern Sudan.
[03:18.01]The SPLA killed 57 of Tang's forces,
[03:21.47]including three major generals, according to the statement.
[03:24.90]In addition, one major general was captured, the statement said.
[03:29.27]Tang himself "narrowly escaped" the fighting,
[03:32.25]according to the statement.
[03:33.61]Officials said it was unclear why Tang's forces attacked the troops,
[03:38.09]but the SPLA said it believes
[03:40.39]he has been in contact with other rebel groups in the region.
[03:44.06]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[03:51.08]3. How many major generals were killed in the attack?
[04:11.57]4. How was Gabriel Tang after the attack?
[04:31.42]News Report Three 
[04:34.15]Thousands will gather in the city center
[04:37.42]just after 5:00 am on Tuesday, April 18,
[04:42.03]to remember victims of the Great Earthquake.
[04:45.46]Organizers say they will also celebrate the heroism of the survivors.
[04:50.67]One hundred years ago, the first small shock
[04:54.73]struck at 5:12 in the morning,
[04:57.81]and the region shook violently for one minute.
[05:00.97]A center of culture and commerce,
[05:03.29]San Francisco was then known as the Paris of the West.
[05:07.72]Just hours earlier, Italian tenor Enrico Caruso
[05:12.18]had appeared in the opera Carmen at the city's opera house.
[05:16.55]The singer later recalled trembling with fear
[05:19.86]as he looked out of the window of his room at the Palace Hotel.
[05:23.86]He saw buildings collapse,
[05:26.28]and heard the screams of men, women and children.
[05:30.10]Historian Eileen Keremitsis is a volunteer guide
[05:34.31]who describes the tragic story for visitors.
[05:37.82]The quake was massive
[05:40.08]and it was centered just off the coast close to the city.
[05:44.30]The shaking damaged or destroyed
[05:46.97]thousands of buildings over a wide area,
[05:49.63]but Keremitsis says most of the severe destruction
[05:53.37]was caused by fires that burned uncontrolled for three days.
[05:58.53]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[06:04.60]5. What does the news item mainly report?
[06:24.00]6. What can we learn about the Great Earthquake?
[06:43.86]7. According to Keremitsis, what caused the most of the destruction?
[07:05.17]Section B
[07:06.66]Directions: In this section, you will hear two long conversations.
[07:12.01]At the end of each conversation, you will hear four questions.
[07:16.08]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[07:20.76]After you hear a question,
[07:22.46]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[07:25.58]marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:29.71]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:33.29]with a single line through the centre.
[07:37.65]Conversation One
[07:40.11]W: So John, I hear you and Arthur share a job, don't you?
[07:44.62]M: Yeah.
[07:45.78]We've shared a sales job at Sonatech for about two years now.
[07:50.36]W: Well, how do you divide up your schedule?
[07:53.93]M: You know, we are both sales representatives,
[07:57.71]and we take orders over the phone.
[08:00.12]When we started job sharing it was difficult,
[08:03.72]because we both worked all day Monday.
[08:06.98]I worked Tuesday and Thursday
[08:09.17]and Arthur worked Wednesday and Friday.
[08:12.46]The problem was that when I was in the office on Tuesday.
[08:16.29]I would talk to people,
[08:18.20]then they would call back on Wednesday with a question.
[08:21.91]But Arthur couldn't answer the question
[08:24.26]and he couldn't ask me about it
[08:26.45]because I wasn't in the office.
[08:28.18]So he had to ask the people to call me back the next day, Thursday.
[08:33.79]Of course, they didn't like to wait until the next day
[08:37.40]to have their question answered.
[08:39.43]W: Yes, that sounds like a problem.
[08:42.28]M: So, finally we decided that Arthur would work in the mornings
[08:47.44]and I would work in the afternoons.
[08:50.39]Now if someone calls with a question for me in the morning,
[08:54.40]Arthur tells them to call me in the afternoon.
[08:57.97]This way, people get their questions answered the same day.
[09:03.24]W: What do you do about vacations?
[09:06.15]M: Well, Sonatech gives the usual two weeks of vacation
[09:10.47]to full-time employees,
[09:12.53]I take a week and Arthur takes a week.
[09:15.43]W: It sounds like job sharing has worked out well for you.
[09:19.59]M: Yes, it has. We are both happy with it.
[09:22.64]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:28.20]8. What do John and Arthur do at Sonatech?
[09:49.56]9. What problem did John and Arthur have when they started job sharing?
[10:11.22]10. What is Arthur's final solution when someone calls with a question for John?
[10:33.66]11. What does John say about their annual vacation?
[10:53.61]Conversation Two
[10:56.42]W: May I see your license, please?
[10:59.03]M: But officer, did I do something wrong?
[11:02.44]W: Do you mean to say you didn't see the speed limit sign back there?
[11:07.08]M: Um, no, ma'am, I guess I didn't.
[11:09.84]W: In other words, you drove by too fast to read it.
[11:15.10]The sign says 35m/h. A school is just nearby, you know?
[11:21.33]M: Don't get me wrong,
[11:23.28]but my speedometer didn't read much faster than that.
[11:27.56]W: Then, why is it that my radar showed you were going 45?
[11:32.72]Let me put it another way.
[11:35.13]I'm going to have to give you a ticket.
[11:38.09]Again, may I see your license, please?
[11:42.70]M: Here it is, officer. But let me explain.
[11:46.78]I was late for an important appointment
[11:49.64]and I was worried that I wouldn't make it on time. So...
[11:53.91]W: Um ha, just a minute, here.
[11:58.17]Your license is no longer valid.
[12:01.22]You should have renewed it two weeks ago.
[12:04.29]I'm going to have to write you up for that, too.
[12:07.80]M: What? Really?
[12:09.56]W: Your license becomes invalid on your birthday
[12:13.26]and that was two weeks ago according to the date here.
[12:17.02]You are in violation of the law---driving without a valid license.
[12:23.10]M: I'm sorry, ma'am. I hadn't realized that.
[12:25.81]W: Here's the ticket for not having a valid license.
[12:29.44]But I'm only going to give you a warning
[12:32.73]about exceeding the speed limit.
[12:35.08]Be careful next time.
[12:37.03]M: Yes, ma'am, officer, I will. Thank you.
[12:40.45]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:46.95]12. Where was the man stopped by the police officer?
[13:08.44]13. What did the man claim about the speed limit sign?
[13:28.81]14. What did the woman say about the man's driving license?
[13:50.22]15. What was the man's penalty?
[14:10.24]Section C
[14:11.49]Directions: In this section, you will hear three passages.
[14:15.53]At the end of each passage, you will hear three or four questions.
[14:20.43]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[14:24.90]After you hear a question,
[14:27.07]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[14:30.22]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:33.32]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:37.49]with a single line through the centre.
[14:39.79]Passage One
[14:43.64]Since I started working part-time at a grocery store,
[14:48.01]I have learned that a customer is more than someone
[14:51.82]who buys something.
[14:53.22]To me, a customer is a person whose memory fails entirely
[14:58.58]once he or she starts to push a shopping card.
[15:02.99]One of the first things customers forget is how to count.
[15:08.43]There's no other way to explain
[15:11.08]how so many people get in their express line,
[15:14.33]which is clearly marked 15 items or less,
[15:18.54]with 20, 25 or even a cart load of items.
[15:23.57]Customers also forget why they came to the store in the first place.
[15:29.58]Just as I finish ringing up an order,
[15:32.56]a customer will say,
[15:34.41]"Oops, I forgot to pick up a fresh loaf of bread.
[15:38.46]I hope you don't mind waiting while I go get it. "
[15:41.83]Five minutes later,
[15:44.04]he's back with the bread, a bottle of milk,
[15:47.11]and three rolls of paper towels.
[15:49.85]Strange is it seems customers also seem to forget
[15:54.16]that they have to pay for their groceries.
[15:57.68]Instead of writing a check or looking for a credit card
[16:01.58]while I am ringing up the groceries,
[16:03.98]my customer will wait until I announce the total.
[16:07.91]Then, in surprise, she says,
[16:11.06]"Oh no, what did I do with my check book?"
[16:15.20]After 5 minutes of digging through her purse,
[16:18.87]she borrows my pen because she's forgotten hers.
[16:22.63]But I have to be tolerant of customers
[16:25.94]because they pay my salary,
[16:28.50]and that's something I can't afford to forget.
[16:32.11]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:37.66]16. What does the speaker say about customers' entering the grocery store?
[16:59.94]17. Which customers are supposed to be in the express line?
[17:20.99]18. What does the speaker say some customers do
[17:26.03]when they arrive at the check-out counter?
[17:42.51]19. What does the speaker say about his job at the end of the talk?
[18:04.95]Passage Two
[18:06.65]The speech delivery style of Europeans and Asians tends to be very formal.
[18:12.76]Speakers of these cultures often read oral presentations
[18:16.77]from carefully written manuscripts.
[18:19.47]On the other hand,
[18:20.63]American speakers are generally more informal
[18:24.89]relative to speakers in other cultures.
[18:28.32]American audiences prefer natural, spontaneous delivery
[18:33.02]that conveys a lively sense of communication.
[18:37.02]They don't relate well to speakers who read from a manuscript.
[18:41.93]If you use an outline of your ideas instead of a prepared text,
[18:45.99]your speech will not only sound more natural,
[18:49.00]but you will also be able to establish better relationship
[18:52.85]with your listeners and keep their attention.
[18:56.65]The language and style you use when making an oral presentation
[19:01.55]should not be the same as the language in style you use when writing.
[19:06.80]Well-written information,
[19:08.25]that is meant to be read,
[19:10.00]does not work as well when it is heard.
[19:12.75]It is, therefore,
[19:14.11]important for you to adapt written texts
[19:16.17]or outlines for presentations.
[19:19.84]Good speakers are much more informal
[19:22.34]when speaking than when writing.
[19:25.19]They also use their own words
[19:26.95]and develop their own speaking styles.
[19:29.40]Whenever possible, they use short words.
[19:33.25]Listeners are appreciated when speakers use simple,
[19:36.85]everyday words in a presentation.
[19:39.91]One advantage is that it is much easier
[19:42.45]for speakers to pronounce short words correctly.
[19:46.07]Another is that long and sophisticated vocabulary choices
[19:51.41]make listening more difficult.
[19:54.42]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:00.10]20. What does the speaker say American audiences prefer?
[20:21.94]21. What should one pay attention to when making an oral presentation?
[20:43.47]22. What does the speaker focus on in the talk?
[21:03.57]Passage Three
[21:06.35]Let children learn to judge their own work
[21:09.61]A child learning to talk
[21:12.27]does not learn by being corrected all the time.
[21:16.04]If corrected too much, he will stop talking.
[21:20.34]He compares a thousand times a day
[21:23.84]the difference between language as he uses it
[21:27.94]and language as those around him use it.
[21:31.40]Bit by bit, he makes the necessary changes
[21:35.20]to make his language like other people's.
[21:38.45]In the same way,
[21:40.70]kids learning to do all the other things
[21:43.55]they learn without adult teachers,
[21:45.87]to walk, run, climb, ride a bike, play games,
[21:50.58]compare their own performance
[21:53.09]with what more skilled people do,
[21:55.95]and slowly make the needed changes.
[21:59.26]But in school we never give a child a chance to detect his mistakes.
[22:05.38]We do it all for him.
[22:07.98]We act as if we thought he would never notice a mistake
[22:11.94]unless it was pointed out to him.
[22:14.60]Soon he becomes dependent on the expert.
[22:18.50]We should let him do it himself.
[22:21.85]Let him figure out,
[22:24.36]with the help of other children if he wants it,
[22:26.82]what this word says,
[22:28.94]what is the answer to that problem,
[22:31.89]whether this is a good way of saying or doing this or that.
[22:35.95]If right answers need to be given,
[22:39.36]as in mathematics or science,
[22:41.81]give him the answer book.
[22:43.81]Let him correct his own papers.
[22:46.61]Why should we teachers waste time on such tedious work?
[22:51.72]Our job should be to help children
[22:54.23]when they tell us that they can't find a way to get the right answer.
[22:59.73]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[23:05.34]23. How does a child learn to do something according to the speaker?
[23:28.02]24. What belief do teachers commonly hold according to the speaker?
[23:49.50]25. What does the speaker imply about the current way of teaching?
[24:10.67]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

[00:18.02]Part II  Listening Comprehension
[00:21.85]Section A
[00:24.83]Directions: In this section, you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.86]At the end of each news report,
[00:32.26]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:34.75]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:39.06]After you hear a question,
[00:41.43]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:44.34]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:47.63]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:51.31]with a single line through the centre.
[00:54.53]News Report One
[00:57.84]Last October, a NASA rocket,
[01:00.83]traveling at a speed of 9,000 kilometers per hour,
[01:04.14]smashed into a deep, dark hole on the moon's south pole.
[01:09.44]Upon impact, the Centaur rocket kicked up a cloud of dust
[01:13.73]and elements from the moon's surface,
[01:16.05]creating a so-called "ejecta-plume"
[01:19.62]that was monitored by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, or LRO.
[01:25.58]Scientists analyzed the findings,
[01:27.98]and preliminary results from this mission suggested
[01:32.35]that there was some form of water on the moon.
[01:35.96]NASA lunar scientist Michael Wargo said those days
[01:40.71]that a wave of findings during the past year makes it certain.
[01:46.24]"We've confirmed that there was indeed water ice in the ejecta-plume,
[01:52.08]and at an abundance that was about 50 percent
[01:55.39]greater than our initial estimates."
[01:57.42]That means that the impact site has more water than some deserts on Earth.
[02:03.81]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[02:09.66]1. According to the news report, what has happened last October?
[02:30.37]2. What did preliminary results from this mission suggest?
[02:52.65]News Report Two
[02:54.22]An American government panel has recommended that pregnant women,
[02:58.85]health-care workers, children and young adults up to the age of 24
[03:04.62]should get priority for the flu vaccine released later this year.
[03:09.01]But the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
[03:12.90]conceded the policy may change if not enough vaccine
[03:16.88]is produced by October.
[03:18.78]Doctor Ann Schuchat of the Center for Disease Control said
[03:22.98]it is vital for pregnant women
[03:24.71]who have breathing illness and fever to get early treatment.
[03:28.64]We think some suitable medicines for them can be lifesaving,
[03:32.56]and that's a very important message.
[03:34.81]We also think it is important for them
[03:36.84]to get seasonal influenza vaccine,
[03:39.49]and today the committee recommended that
[03:41.85]when vaccine is available,
[03:43.83]and we have a decision to go forward that the pregnant women
[03:47.33]really out of consider getting the H1N1 vaccine.
[03:52.70]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.

[04:21.05]4. Why do pregnant women enjoy the top priority to get vaccine?
[04:43.33]News Report Three
[04:46.12]Hundreds of residents and holidaymakers
[04:48.87]along southern Australia's popular Great Ocean Road
[04:52.90]were forced to move out on Thursday as hot,
[04:56.55]windy weather threatened to recharge bushfires
[05:00.12]that destroyed more than 100 homes on Christmas Day.
[05:04.16]Residents in three coastal towns in the popular holiday area
[05:09.41]were advised to leave their homes as temperatures
[05:12.58]were forecast to reach a high of almost 40 degrees Celsius.
[05:17.41]The hot summer weather threatened to expand fires
[05:21.36]that have been burning for almost two weeks.
[05:24.78]The fires were started by a lightning strike on Dec. 19
[05:29.55]and continue to burn and spread.
[05:32.63]The Country Fire Authority estimates the fire
[05:35.92]has burnt out more than 25 square kilometers of land.
[05:40.53]Authorities estimate that 116 homes
[05:44.00]were destroyed by the fires on Christmas Day.
[05:47.23]The Great Ocean Road is one of Australia's biggest tourist
[05:52.11]draws with its spectacular scenery
[05:55.23]and unusual offshore rock formations.
[05:58.51]Parts of the road remained closed to traffic on Thursday
[06:02.77]during what is typically one of its busiest times of the year.
[06:07.46]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[06:12.78]5. What happened on Australia's Great Ocean Road on Thursday?
[06:34.53]6. Why should the local residents leave their homes?
[06:54.82]7. When did the bushfires start?
[07:14.46]Section B
[07:16.22]Directions: In this section,
[07:18.64]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:21.12]At the end of each conversation,
[07:23.29]you will hear four questions.
[07:25.11]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:27.72]will be spoken only once.
[07:30.09]After you hear a question,
[07:31.61]you must choose the best answer
[07:33.68]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:39.38]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:42.70]with a single line through the centre.
[07:47.02]Conversation One
[07:49.26]W: Are you all ready for Christmas?
[07:51.29]M: No, I haven't even started.
[07:54.63]I've done zero shopping.
[07:56.61]W: Well, you'd better get going.
[07:59.55]Christmas is only a week away.
[08:01.67]M: I have to tell you that I'm one of those people
[08:05.08]who really get stressed out by the Christmas rush.
[08:08.45]W: Oh, I'm not. I love the holidays.
[08:11.48]I love the crowds, the shopping, the holidays, the music,
[08:15.78]the food, the parties, and all the presents.
[08:20.07]M: That's just the beginning.
[08:22.32]My wife always spends too much money on Christmas.
[08:26.64]That takes me till April to pay off all our Christmas bills.
[08:31.08]W: Don't be a miser about it.
[08:33.38]Think about your kids.
[08:34.79]Didn't you use to love Christmas when you were a kid?
[08:38.32]M: I guess so. I don't remember.
[08:42.00]W: I know you did. You know, maybe Christmas is for kids,
[08:47.28]but you can still enjoy it through the eyes of your children.
[08:49.88]M: Well, kids enjoy it because they don't have to do all the shopping
[08:54.64]and pay all the bills.
[08:56.19]W: Maybe that's true. But you know as well as I do,
[09:00.83]that Christmas is more than shopping and trees.
[09:03.94]It's about what's in your heart and how you can make others happy.
[09:08.22]M: You're right. You're absolutely right.
[09:10.92]I'm going to try harder to be nice to people
[09:14.06]and try to keep the true spirit of Christmas in my heart.
[09:18.47]W: I'm glad to hear it.
[09:19.89]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:26.36]8. What does the woman try to do in the conversation?
[09:47.30]9. When does the conversation take place?
[10:08.32]10. What is the man's feeling about Christmas?
[10:27.86]11. What will the man most probably do after the conversation?
[10:51.05]Conversation Two
[10:53.26]W: It's a lovely day today!
[10:55.02]What would you like to do?
[10:56.70]M: I really feel like doing something outdoors.
[10:59.84]Perhaps we could go hill walking?
[11:02.77]W: Mm, I'm not really in the mood for hill walking.
[11:07.44]Why don't we just go swimming?
[11:09.30]M: That suits me.
[11:11.18]But it will take an hour or two.
[11:13.85]Do you like to do something else first?
[11:16.15]Maybe we could go cycling?
[11:18.55]W: I don't think I enjoy that very much.
[11:22.10]Actually I'm not a good cyclist.
[11:25.54]Maybe we could have a meal at the new Italian restaurant.
[11:29.46]M: That's fine for me. I haven't been to that restaurant yet.
[11:34.27]So that's decided then.
[11:35.92]A meal at the new Italian restaurant, then go to swim.
[11:39.97]Great! So, when should we meet?
[11:43.07]W: We'd better get to the restaurant a bit early
[11:45.58]because it might be very busy.
[11:47.55]I think we need to get there by 11:00.
[11:50.63]M: Er, can we make it a little later, say, 11:20?
[11:56.58]I have to visit my grandma this morning
[11:59.35]and I don't think I can make it by then.
[12:02.32]W: No problem. I'll go straight to the restaurant
[12:04.88]at 11:00 and get you a table.
[12:07.20]M: Great!
[12:08.48]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:13.97]12. Why doesn't the man want to go swimming?
[12:35.82]13. What will the two speakers do first?
[12:55.91]14. What can be inferred about the restaurant mentioned?
[13:17.49]15. Why can't the man meet the woman at 11:00?
[13:40.44]Section C
[13:41.94]Directions: In this section,
[13:44.11]you will hear three passages.
[13:46.02]At the end of each passage,
[13:47.72]you will hear three or four questions.
[13:50.62]Both the passage and the questions
[13:52.87]will be spoken only once.
[13:55.12]After you hear a question,
[13:57.27]you must choose the best answer
[13:59.32]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:04.02]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:07.92]with a single line through the centre.
[14:11.37]Passage One
[14:12.77]Twin sisters are supposed to be very much alike, are they not?
[14:18.11]Well, my twin sister Jane and I do look alike,
[14:23.81]however, we are different in many ways.
[14:27.59]We like very different styles of clothing.
[14:30.83]I prefer to dress informally, whereas my twin sister dresses like
[14:37.07]a model,
[14:37.87]always wearing the latest fashions.
[14:41.28]We have very similar character in most ways.
[14:45.30]I do not get angry easily and enjoy being with friends,
[14:49.89]and in these respects, my twin sister feels the same.
[14:55.18]But she likes loud music and modern dances,
[14:59.11]while I find that nightclubs give me a headache.
[15:02.52]She is always with friends, is a favorite with all the teachers,
[15:07.46]and never wants to have any children,
[15:10.96]whereas I prefer to be alone at times,
[15:13.90]don't really try to impress my teachers
[15:17.07]and intend some day to have a family of my own.
[15:21.68]We have tried to live in the same room several times,
[15:25.20]and even agreed on the color we like best, and the kind of
[15:29.64]furniture we want,
[15:31.15]but I like to keep things neat and orderly,
[15:34.30]while my twin sister acts as if there were a servant around to
[15:38.67]pick up all the things
[15:40.19]that get thrown on the floor.
[15:42.30]I like to go to bed early and get up early.
[15:45.76]In contrast, she doesn't seem to have any definite habits,
[15:50.89]often goes to bed very late, and then sleeps late the next day.
[15:57.45]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:03.98]16. What kind of clothes does the speaker like?
[16:23.63]17. What do the twin sisters have in common?
[16:43.59]18. Why isn't the speaker likely to live in the same room with
[16:52.30]her sister?
[17:08.32]Passage Two
[17:09.93]Until the twentieth century cigarettes were not an important
[17:13.84]threat to public health.
[17:16.94]Since the cigarette industry began in the 1870s,
[17:20.68]however, the cigarette-manufacturing machine has developed rapidly.
[17:26.30]This made it possible to produce great numbers of cigarettes very quickly,
[17:32.63]and it reduced the price.
[17:35.09]Today cigarette smoking is a widespread habit.
[17:38.95]About forty-three percent of the men and thirty-one percent of
[17:43.98]the adult women
[17:45.14]in the United States smoke cigarettes regularly.
[17:49.52]It is encouraging to note,
[17:51.47]however, that millions of people have given up the smoking habit.
[17:56.48]Income, education and occupation all play a part
[18:01.14]in determining a person's smoking habits.
[18:04.16]City people smoke more than people living on farms.
[18:07.92]Well-educated men with high income are less likely to smoke cigarettes
[18:14.38]than men with fewer years of schooling and lower incomes.
[18:19.03]On the other hand, if a well-educated man with a high income
[18:23.76]smokes at all,
[18:25.17]he is likely to smoke more packs of cigarettes per day.
[18:29.80]The situation is somewhat different for women.
[18:32.71]There are slightly more smokers among women
[18:36.07]with higher family income and higher education
[18:39.47]than among the lower income and lower education groups.
[18:44.28]These more highly educated women tend to smoke more heavily.
[18:48.64]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:54.99]19. What reduced the price of cigarettes?
[19:16.56]20. What is the percentage of American adult women who smoke regularly?
[19:39.32]21. What plays a part in determining a person's smoking habit?
[20:00.77]22. Which of the following is true according to the passage?
[20:23.34]Passage Three
[20:25.06]Life on earth depends on the sun.
[20:27.73]Day after day we see its light and feel its warmth,
[20:32.52]but we do not often consider their origin.
[20:36.49]Yet there are many remarkable things about the sun.
[20:40.17]One is its distance from the earth.
[20:42.71]This is about 93 million miles.
[20:46.76]A journey of this distance, even if it could be made,
[20:51.01]would take several hundred years even in the fastest rocket.
[20:56.27]The sun makes us feel hot,
[20:58.58]even at a distance of 93 million miles.
[21:02.30]This is not surprising.
[21:04.26]The temperature on the sun is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
[21:09.93]But we receive only a small part of the heat.
[21:13.43]The total heat of the sun could melt a column of ice
[21:17.32]two and a quarter miles thick and 93 million miles high in a second.
[21:24.43]The brightness of the sun is equally astonishing.
[21:28.71]As we said earlier, we receive only a very small part of the sun's heat.
[21:35.01]We also receive only a very small part of its light.
[21:38.57]This is sufficient for the growth of trees and plants,
[21:42.33]and for the existence of living creatures on the earth.
[21:46.26]Too much heat and light would destroy the balance of life.
[21:49.93]The heat and light from the sun come in just the right quantities
[21:54.58]for life on earth.
[21:57.89]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:03.01]23. What remarkable things are mentioned in the passage?
[22:26.06]24. What is the temperature on the sun?
[22:47.04]25. Which of the following is true according to the passage?
[23:08.38]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

[00:14.84]College English Test Band 4
[00:18.28]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:22.25]Section A
[00:23.72]Directions: In this section, you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.39]At the end of each news report,
[00:31.38]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:33.96]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:38.51]After you hear a question,
[00:40.69]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:43.64]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:47.33]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:50.78]with a single line through the centre.
[00:53.18]News Report One
[00:56.29]Fifteen passengers were burned alive
[00:58.96]when a passenger bus was set on fire
[01:01.02]by unknown men in Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province,
[01:06.30]an official said.
[01:07.82]Naseer Ahmed Nasir, deputy commissioner in the city of Sibi,
[01:11.99]said four men on motorcycles initially opened fire
[01:15.59]on a parked passenger bus at a hotel.
[01:18.26] "The armed men then came close to the bus and splashed petrol,
[01:22.62]setting it on fire," he said.
[01:25.01]He said most of the dead were either children or women.
[01:28.91]Balochistan, near the Afghan border, is rich in natural resources.
[01:34.30]But it is also in under a riot.
[01:37.47]Militants there have for years
[01:39.96]complained that the central government
[01:42.29]has paid little attention to them and their economic needs.
[01:45.53]They have been fighting Pakistani military forces for self-rule.
[01:49.65]Pakistan has said the militants in Balochistan do not
[01:54.01]have links to the Islamic hard-liners
[01:56.23]who have launched attacks in other parts of the country.
[02:00.49]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[02:06.08]1. Who were most of the victims according to the news?
[02:27.29]2. What are the militants in Balochistan dissatisfied with?
[02:47.95]News Report Two
[02:50.35]A UN agency says there are major funding gaps
[02:54.55]in efforts to help the agricultural sector adapt to climate change.
[02:59.27]The Food and Agriculture Organization,
[03:02.52]the FAO, says this could affect food security.
[03:06.70]The warning comes as the UN Climate Change Conference
[03:11.29]continues in Cancun, Mexico.
[03:14.88]The World Bank estimates it will cost about $2.5 billion a year
[03:20.53]---for the next 40 years---
[03:22.30]to help agriculture in developing countries adapt to climate change.
[03:27.92]Other estimates say costs could run as high as $14 billion a year.
[03:33.47]However, the FAO says,
[03:36.79] "available financing mechanisms are substantially insufficient
[03:41.80]to meet the climate change and food security challenges
[03:45.24]faced by the agricultural sector."
[03:48.29]This, despite the fact that the FAO says
[03:52.36]there are many examples of how agriculture can become more.
[03:58.06]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[04:03.48]3. According to the World Bank,
[04:06.57]how much does it cost to tackle agricultural challenges yearly?
[04:25.99]4. According to FAO,
[04:29.08]what is the problem faced by the agricultural sector?
[04:47.87]News Report Three 
[04:49.44]The U.S. Federal Reserve announced yesterday
[04:52.43]it was raising interest rates for the first time since 2006.
[04:57.22]Known as the Fed, it's America's central bank.
[05:01.07]It's led by Janet Yellen.
[05:02.88]Its job is to help stabilize America's financial system.
[05:07.14]The Fed makes moves to try to lower
[05:09.53]unemployment and control inflation,
[05:11.75]when the price of goods goes up too fast for people to afford them.
[05:15.90]Because the U.S. economy is growing,
[05:18.68]the Fed raised its key interest rate
[05:21.18]by a quarter of a percentage point, not much.
[05:23.75]But gradual rate increases are likely in the New Year.
[05:28.02]That means you'll have to pay more interest
[05:30.63]if you borrow money, higher loan rates for home buyers,
[05:34.67]higher interest rates if you finance a car,
[05:37.54]higher student loan rates for people who enter colleges afterwards.
[05:41.91]Eventually, savings accounts could earn a little more interest.
[05:46.42]A decade since the last "Star Wars",
[05:49.26]and nearly just as long, nine years,
[05:51.87]since the Fed last changed interest rates.
[05:54.79]But now, it's time for the Fed to awaken,
[05:58.16]because after three episodes of quantitative easing,
[06:01.96]Janet Yellen must now use her most powerful weapon
[06:05.43]to restore balance in the economy.
[06:08.84]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[06:14.30]5. What will happen to interest rates in the US?
[06:36.20]6. Why did the Fed change interest rates?
[06:55.46]7. Who will benefit from the change of interest rates?
[07:15.78]Section B
[07:17.37]Directions: In this section, you will hear two long conversations.
[07:22.59]At the end of each conversation, you will hear four questions.
[07:26.34]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[07:30.95]After you hear a question,
[07:32.92]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[07:36.18]marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:40.38]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:43.89]with a single line through the centre.
[07:47.21]Conversation One
[07:49.50]M: What are you going to have?
[07:50.75]W: I have no idea. Could you help me with the menu?
[07:54.92]M: Yes, sure. These are starters,
[07:58.33]and these are main courses and these are desserts. See?
[08:03.50]W: What's the alternative?
[08:05.64]M: The alternative is to order a complete dinner.
[08:08.46]For a set price you get your choice of soup or juice,
[08:11.81]one dish with potato and vegetable, salad, bread and butter
[08:17.58]and sometimes coffee and sometimes dessert.
[08:20.89]W: And you pay the price listed next to the main course?
[08:25.18]M: Right. Like the roast beef dinner is $7.85-plus tax and tip, of course.
[08:33.10]W: It all looks pretty expensive to me.
[08:35.66]M: It's not. This is only a bit more expensive than McDonald's.
[08:40.62]So enjoy yourself. We're celebrating, remember?
[08:44.06]Order anything you'd like to try; it's all on me.
[08:48.21]W: You're very kind.
[08:50.13]M: Friends are friends. I cannot get promoted often.
[08:53.64]Are you ready to order?
[08:54.90]W: Ah, can you tell me what Hot Fudge Sundae is?
[08:59.41]M: That's a dessert. It's an English specialty.
[09:03.36]It's a kind of ice cream with a hot sticky sauce over the top
[09:07.99]---very sweet and fattening!
[09:10.78]W: I don't really like the sound of that.
[09:13.00]How come there is English food?
[09:15.31]I thought we agreed to eat American food.
[09:17.86]M: Our country is made up of people from all over the world,
[09:21.32]so besides collected words and phrases from every language,
[09:25.35]we've also absorbed recipes.
[09:27.95]We even have a lot of Chinese restaurants now.
[09:31.00]W: Which is better, French or Chinese cuisine?
[09:34.94]M: I'd say it's a toss-up. I love them both.
[09:38.55]W: I didn't know you were so fond of foreign foods.
[09:41.55]When my boss promotes me,
[09:44.17]I will take you to a French restaurant near my company.
[09:47.13]The food there is delicious.
[09:49.31]M: Oh, we will have a second dinner soon.
[09:53.27]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:58.44]8. What's the relationship between the two speakers?
[10:17.94]9. Why does the woman think the man is kind?
[10:36.68]10. Which of the following statements is true about the man's country?
[10:56.74]11. What does the man think of the woman?
[11:15.12]Conversation Two
[11:17.42]M: Hi. Welcome to Heavenly Pies.
[11:20.19]May I take your order?
[11:22.13]W: Uh... yes.
[11:23.65]I'd like the fried chicken steak.
[11:26.20]M: Okay. Would you like fries, bread,
[11:29.43]or rice with your meal?
[11:31.16]W: Umm. I'll take the rice.
[11:33.79]M: Would you care for anything to drink?
[11:36.39]W: Yeah. I'll take a medium Sprite.
[11:39.31]M: Okay. A medium Sprite.
[11:41.64]And what kind of dressing would you like with your salad?
[11:45.41]It comes with the fried steak.
[11:47.43]W: What dressings do you have?
[11:50.01]M: We have French, Italian, blue cheese, and ranch.
[11:54.98]W: Oh! Ranch, please.
[11:56.90]M: Would you like anything else?
[11:58.66]W: Well, I'd like to see your pie menu.
[12:01.33]That's the main reason why I like to dine here.
[12:04.68]M: Oh, I'm sorry,
[12:06.96]but we aren't serving pies today.
[12:09.29]W: Huh?
[12:10.25]M: Well, you see, Dave,
[12:12.08]our baker,
[12:13.31]slipped on a banana peel back in our kitchen two days ago,
[12:17.21]and injured his back.
[12:18.63]W: Oh, no.
[12:20.38]M: He'll be out for at least two weeks.
[12:23.08]In the meantime,
[12:24.56]we're serving ice cream sundaes instead. Sorry.
[12:28.27]W: I'm sorry to hear that.
[12:30.31]I hope he gets better soon.
[12:32.71]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:39.59]12. What does the woman order?
[12:57.86]13. What kind of dressing does she ask for?
[13:16.62]14. Why does the woman like to dine at Heavenly Pies?
[13:37.31]15. Why is the restaurant not serving pies today?
[13:57.67]Section C
[13:59.04]Directions: In this section, 
[14:01.14]you will hear three passages.
[14:02.94]At the end of each passage, 
[14:04.78]you will hear three or four questions..
[14:07.74]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[14:12.43]After you hear a question,
[14:14.49]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[14:17.69]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:21.03]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:25.17]with a single line through the centre.
[14:27.67]Passage One
[14:30.07]Nowadays motorcycling is fast becoming one of Americans' most popular sports.
[14:38.08]However, there are several things about motorcycling
[14:41.45]that the average citizen dislikes.
[14:44.71]Motorcyclists frequently get dirty.
[14:47.82]In fact, they are dirty.
[14:50.31]On the road there is little to protect them from mud,
[14:54.28]insects and bird droppings.
[14:57.35]For practical reasons,
[14:59.23]they are often dressed in old clothing,
[15:01.93]which looks much less respectable than the clothing of people
[15:05.93]who ride in cars.
[15:07.38]For the same reason, motorcyclists usually wear dark colors.
[15:12.64]Of course, the danger of motorcycling also helps account for
[15:17.17]many people's low opinion of the sport.
[15:20.17]Its defenders, however, claim that careful cyclists are in less danger
[15:25.84]than it's commonly believed.
[15:28.08]He must pay careful attention to his driving.
[15:31.37]From that point of view, a man on a motorcycle is safer than a man in a car.
[15:38.87]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:44.49]16. Why do motorcyclists often dress in old and dark clothing?
[16:06.19]17. What's the average citizen's opinion about motorcycling?
[16:26.77]18. How can a motorcyclist be safer than a car driver?
[16:47.25]Passage Two
[16:48.90]Speech is one of the most important ways of communicating.
[16:53.00]It consists of far more than just making noises.
[16:56.79]To talk and also to be understood by other people,
[17:00.63]we have to speak a language, that is,
[17:03.64]we have to use combinations of sounds
[17:07.24]that everyone agrees stand for a particular object or idea.
[17:12.28]Communication would be impossible if everyone made up their own language.
[17:17.24]Learning a language properly is very important.
[17:20.86]The basic vocabulary of English is not very large,
[17:25.31]and only about 2,000 words are needed to speak it quite well.
[17:30.74]But the more words you know,
[17:32.10]the more ideas you can express,
[17:34.68]and the more precise you can be about their exact meaning.
[17:38.94]Words are the main thing we use in communicating what we want to say.
[17:44.36]The way we say the words is also very important.
[17:48.60]Our tone of voice can express many emotions and shows
[17:52.92]whether we are pleased or angry, for instance.
[17:56.32]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:03.68]19. What are used to stand for a particular object or idea
[18:10.21]when we speak a language?
[18:26.21]20. What if everyone made up their own language?
[18:45.58]21. What is also important besides the main thing in communicating?
[19:06.71]Passage Three
[19:08.29]Father's Day was first observed in Spokane,
[19:11.63]Washington, in 1910.
[19:14.29]Mrs. Dodd first proposed the idea of a "father's day" in 1906.
[19:21.63]Mrs. Dodd wanted a special day to honor her father, William Smart,
[19:27.45]who was widowed when his wife died in childbirth
[19:31.13]after their sixth child was born.
[19:34.19]Mr. Smart was left to raise the newborn
[19:37.67]and his other five children by himself.
[19:41.18]Mrs. Dodd wanted Father's Day to be celebrated
[19:45.87]on the first Sunday in June,
[19:48.55]her father's birthday.
[19:50.52]But it wasn't until 1966
[19:54.07]that President Lyndon Johnson signed a presidential proclamation,
[19:58.99]declaring the 3rd Sunday of June as Father's Day.
[20:03.65]In 1972,
[20:06.54]President Richard Nixon established a permanent national ceremony of Father's Day
[20:12.96]to be held on the third Sunday of June,
[20:16.32]coming almost sixty years
[20:18.81]after Mother's Day had been proclaimed a national holiday.
[20:22.69]Today, Father's Day has become a day to not only honor your father,
[20:29.82]but all men who act as a father-like figure,
[20:34.03]such as stepfathers, uncles, grandfathers, and adult males.
[20:41.32]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:48.01]22. Who first proposed the idea of a "Father's Day"?
[21:08.44]23. When was "Father's Day" established to be a permanent national day?
[21:29.13]24. When is "Father's Day" celebrated nowadays?
[21:49.57]25. For what purpose do we celebrate "Father's Day" according to the passage?
[22:11.34]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

[00:17.72]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:21.98]Section A
[00:24.23]Directions: In this section, you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.63]At the end of each news report,
[00:31.68]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:34.10]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:38.61]After you hear a question,
[00:40.66]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:43.63]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:47.44]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:50.65]with a single line through the centre.
[00:54.36]News Report One
[00:56.02]How do you choose a college?
[00:58.83]Some of you might choose a school based on the courses that it offers.
[01:03.09]Some might choose one that's close to home, or really far away.
[01:07.54]But how about for a money-back guarantee?
[01:11.19]Lansing Community College in Michigan
[01:14.19]is offering that deal to some students.
[01:16.90]If you take certain classes,
[01:18.91]and if you don't get a job within one year after you finish,
[01:23.04]you can get your money back!
[01:25.29]There is some fine print to this.
[01:27.45]You can't miss any classes,
[01:30.20]you have to do all your assignments,
[01:32.20]and you have to prove that you've been looking for a job.
[01:36.07]It's an interesting idea,
[01:38.27]especially in a state whose unemployment rate is nearly 12 percent.
[01:44.76]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[01:50.11]1. What may be the advantage for Lansing Community College?
[02:11.03]2. What is the unemployment rate in Michigan?
[02:30.88]News Report Two
[02:32.93]Well, we're taking you to Australia next today,
[02:37.74]where the state of Queensland in northeast Australia
[02:40.86]is struggling through the effects of a powerful hurricane.
[02:45.06]If Queensland sounds familiar,
[02:47.37]this same region was hit with severe flooding recently.
[02:51.44]This time, the disaster is Cyclone Yasi.
[02:55.45]Yasi could be one of the worst hurricanes Australia has ever seen.
[03:00.37]We want you to look at this video.
[03:02.89]You can see what looks like a sign that got blown down,
[03:06.34]flying through the street, being ripped apart.
[03:09.61]People in Queensland were warned about Yasi a few days ago,
[03:13.51]so they had some time to get ready.
[03:16.07]But one official said it could be a tough couple days.
[03:21.32]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[03:26.48]3. What are the Australians suffering from?
[03:46.10]4. What can we learn about Yasi from the news?
[04:05.71]News Report Three 
[04:07.94]India is home to more than 1.2 billion people
[04:11.86]and second only to China's population.
[04:14.46]Because of that huge population and the fact
[04:17.11]that it's a federal republic like the U.S.
[04:20.03]India is often called the world's largest democracy.
[04:23.96]India's population is also young.
[04:26.71]Its median age is 27 years old.
[04:29.90]In the U.S. that age is closer to 37.
[04:33.26]It's no wonder why so many Indians
[04:35.66]who are close to the voting age of 18
[04:37.96]are realizing they have political power.
[04:41.27]This is something that country's politicians are noticing, too.
[04:44.88]Many young people are first time voters.
[04:48.23]Given that India's youth makes up half of its billion plus population,
[04:53.00]how India's young vote will determine the country's future.
[04:56.83]They are obviously really frustrated
[04:59.39]with current political situation in their country.
[05:02.19]The only government these youngsters
[05:04.39]have really known is the current Congress party Led One,
[05:07.65]which is in power for the last ten years.
[05:11.11]During that time, prices have risen sharply.
[05:14.27]The price of petrol is doubled.
[05:16.74]Some young people are going to vote for a different party,
[05:20.44]one that will fight inflation
[05:22.19]and will take firm action to control inflation
[05:25.16]in the difficult global economy.
[05:28.11]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[05:34.21]5. What is the median age of India?
[05:53.62]6. What can we learn about the young people in India?
[06:13.87]7. What is the current largest economic problem in India?
[06:34.97]Section B
[06:36.37]Directions: In this section, you will hear two long conversations.
[06:41.83]At the end of each conversation, you will hear four questions.
[06:45.66]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[06:50.34]After you hear a question,
[06:52.09]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[06:55.29]marked A), B), C) and D).
[06:59.42]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:02.94]with a single line through the centre.
[07:06.33]Conversation One
[07:08.55]W: Good evening, and welcome to this week's business world,
[07:12.90]the program for and about business people.
[07:16.55]Tonight we have Mr. Steven Kayne,
[07:19.01]who has just taken over an established bicycle shop.
[07:22.79]Tell us, Mr. Kayne, what made you want to run your own store?
[07:27.82]M: Well, I always loved racing bikes and fixing them.
[07:31.62]When I was working full-time as a salesman for a big company,
[07:35.82]I seldom had time to enjoy my hobby.
[07:38.23]I knew then that as soon as I had enough money
[07:41.33]to get my own business going, I'll do it.
[07:44.13]I had my heart set on it and I didn't let anything stand in my way.
[07:49.26]When I went down to the bank and got a business loan,
[07:53.17]I knew I'd love being my own boss.
[07:56.31]Now my time is my own.
[07:58.28]I open the store when I want and leave when I want.
[08:02.38]W: You mean you don't keep regular hours?
[08:06.05]M: Well, the sign on my store says the hours are ten to six,
[08:10.66]but if business is slower than usual,
[08:12.91]I can just lock up and take off early.
[08:15.62]W: Have you hired any employees to work with you yet?
[08:18.99]M: Yeah, a couple of friends of mine who love biking as much as I do.
[08:23.49]They help me out a few days a week.
[08:26.44]It's great because we play cards
[08:29.31]or just sit around and talk when there are no customers.
[08:33.23]W: Thank you, Mr. Kayne.
[08:34.93]We wish you success in your new business.
[08:39.06]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[08:43.82]8. What is the woman doing?
[09:03.04]9. What did Mr. Kayne do before he took over the bicycle shop?
[09:23.89]10. Why did the man take over a bicycle shop?
[09:43.66]11. What do we learn about the people working in the shop?
[10:03.26]Conversation Two
[10:05.52]W: Well, the main activities in the region were historically steel
[10:09.49]and paper processing.
[10:10.90]M: Yes, but I'm not quite sure about the status of those industries now.
[10:16.02]Could you tell us something about that?
[10:18.44]W: Yes, of course. In fact, they are less significant,
[10:22.40]but steel-related manufacturing still accounts for 44% of industrial activity.
[10:30.32]So it's still very important.
[10:33.18]In fact, 80% of Spain's machine tools are from the Basque Country.
[10:38.50]As for paper processing, there's still a little.
[10:42.40]But it's no longer what it once was in the region.
[10:45.90]So, is that clear?
[10:48.40]M: Yes, thanks.
[10:50.26]W: Now, to get back to what I was saying,
[10:52.93]there's a lot of unemployment
[10:54.63]as well as geographical problems in the region.
[10:57.94]M: Sorry, Victoria. What do you mean by geographical problems?
[11:02.39]W: Well, what I mean is the area is very hilly, mountainous in parts.
[11:08.51]So there used to be transport problems,
[11:11.88]now though there are new train links and better roads,
[11:17.19]but it may be
[11:18.44]that some smaller towns inland remain not very well connected,
[11:23.40]is that OK? Does that make sense?
[11:26.53]When we talk about specific location suggestions for the factory,
[11:31.55]we'll see this in more detail,
[11:33.76]so we'll come back to this question, OK?
[11:36.76]M: OK, right.
[11:38.02]W: So I was about to say something about the work force in the region
[11:42.57]and the level of training and education.
[11:45.20]In general, it's very good and improving.
[11:48.70]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[11:54.91]12. What was one of the main industrial activities in the region?
[12:16.41]13. What does the woman say about steel-related manufacturing in the region?
[12:37.32]14. What problem hinders the region's development?
[12:58.52]15. What will the speakers discuss later?
[13:19.81]Section C
[13:21.17]Directions: In this section, you will hear three passages.
[13:25.27]At the end of each passage, you will hear three or four questions.
[13:30.02]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[13:34.73]After you hear a question, you must choose the best answer
[13:38.68]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[13:43.13]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[13:47.38]with a single line through the centre.
[13:49.98]Passage One
[13:52.19]I first met Joe Gumps when we were both 9 years old,
[13:57.05]which is probably the only reason he is one of my best friends.
[14:01.65]If I had first met Joe as a freshman in high school,
[14:05.48]we wouldn't even have had the chance to get to know each other.
[14:09.53]Joe is a day student,
[14:11.38]but I am a boarding student.
[14:13.93]We haven't been in the same classes,
[14:16.59]sports or extracurricular activities.
[14:20.50]Nonetheless, I spend nearly every weekend at his house,
[14:24.72]and we talk on the phone every night.
[14:28.05]This is not to say that we would not have been compatible
[14:31.28]if we had first met in our freshman year.
[14:34.94]Rather, we would not have been likely
[14:37.07]to spend enough time getting to know each other,
[14:39.48]due to the lack of immediately visible mutual interests.
[14:43.24]In fact, to be honest,
[14:45.84]I struggle even now to think of things we have in common,
[14:49.44]but maybe that's what makes us enjoy each other's company so much.
[14:54.96]When I look at my friendship with Joe,
[14:57.11]I wonder how many people I've known whom I never disliked
[15:01.57]but simply didn't take the time to get to know.
[15:05.09]Thanks to Joe,
[15:06.59]I have realized how little basis there is,
[15:09.54]for the social divisions that exist in every community.
[15:13.30]Since this realization,
[15:15.65]I have begun to make an even more determined effort
[15:18.72]to find friends in unexpected people and places.
[15:23.05]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[15:29.85]16. Why does the speaker say Joe Gumps became one of his best friends?
[15:52.22]17. Where does the speaker spend most of his weekends?
[16:11.42]18. What has the speaker learned from his friendship with Joe?
[16:32.68]Passage Two
[16:34.88]It was a bad night for Louis.
[16:37.86]His research in the neighboring town had taken longer
[16:41.21]than he expected.
[16:42.81]It was late and he was very tired when he drove home.
[16:47.05]He turned into his building's parking lot,
[16:49.75]but all the spaces were full.
[16:52.00]He drove back out onto the street looking for a parking space.
[16:56.85]The first block was full.
[16:59.00]The next block was almost empty.
[17:01.60]Louis didn't see a no-parking sign,
[17:04.60]but he suspected that if parking were allowed there,
[17:07.57]most of the spaces would be filled.
[17:10.21]Then he saw a small parking lot with two free spaces.
[17:14.88]He was so glad to see them
[17:16.73]that he didn't even think to read the sign by the entrance.
[17:20.58]He drove in, parked, and hurried home to go to bed.
[17:25.34]The next morning he went back to the lot to get his car.
[17:29.51]It was gone.
[17:30.66]He ran home and telephoned the city police to say
[17:34.37]that his car had been stolen.
[17:36.39]It took the police only a minute to tell him what had happened.
[17:40.65]His car had been on a private lot.
[17:43.35]It had been taken away by the police.
[17:46.87]Louis had to take a taxi to the city garage
[17:50.14]far from the center of town.
[17:52.64]He had to pay a fee of 40 dollar to get his car back.
[17:56.74]In addition, he got a parking ticket
[17:59.55]--- his first one ever in Greenville.
[18:02.86]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:09.48]19. Where did Louis intend to park his car
[18:13.70]when he came back from work one night?
[18:31.51]20. What did Louis think had happened to his car the next morning?
[18:51.55]21. Where did Louis finally get his car back?
[19:11.09]Passage Three
[19:13.23]Well, to pick up where we left off last time,
[19:16.46]I believe we agreed that creativity is a mysterious idea.
[19:21.21]It's one of those things we all recognize when we see it.
[19:25.66]But we don't really understand what it is.
[19:28.56]We seem to feel that some people are naturally creative,
[19:32.83]but we don't know how they got that way.
[19:35.48]Is creativity a natural gift like good looks?
[19:40.30]Or is it something that can be acquired like knowledge?
[19:44.21]Perhaps if we analyze the creative process carefully,
[19:48.38]we might get some insight into what it is
[19:51.20]and how it might work in our lives.
[19:54.56]The creative process has always been accepted
[19:57.88]as the source of all important work in the arts.
[20:01.70]But we should not think the creativity plays a role only in the arts.
[20:07.00]Every major scientific discovery
[20:09.90]began with someone imagining the world to look differently
[20:14.27]from the way others saw it.
[20:16.08]And this is what the creativity is all about:
[20:19.48]imagining the world in a new way.
[20:22.69]And despite what you may believe
[20:25.14]about the limits of your own creative imaginations,
[20:28.85]we all have the potential to imagine the world
[20:31.87]in an absolutely new way.
[20:35.01]In fact, you were born with it.
[20:38.36]It is your birth right as a human being.
[20:40.72]And what's more,
[20:43.13]you use it every day,
[20:45.14]almost every moment of your life.
[20:47.50]Your creative imagination
[20:50.10]is what you use to make sense of your experiences.
[20:53.90]It's your creative mind that gets meaning
[20:57.14]from the chaos of your experiences and brings order to your world.
[21:03.12]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[21:08.84]22. What did the speaker most probably discuss last time?
[21:28.59]23. What is a widely accepted idea about the creative process?
[21:51.61]24. What leads to major scientific discoveries according to the speaker?
[22:13.08]25. What does the speaker imply about the creative process?
[22:33.82]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

[00:18.02]Part II  Listening Comprehension
[00:21.85]Section A
[00:24.83]Directions: In this section, you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.86]At the end of each news report,
[00:32.26]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:34.75]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:39.06]After you hear a question,
[00:41.43]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:44.34]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:47.63]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:51.31]with a single line through the centre.
[00:54.53]News Report One
[00:57.84]Last October, a NASA rocket,
[01:00.83]traveling at a speed of 9,000 kilometers per hour,
[01:04.14]smashed into a deep, dark hole on the moon's south pole.
[01:09.44]Upon impact, the Centaur rocket kicked up a cloud of dust
[01:13.73]and elements from the moon's surface,
[01:16.05]creating a so-called "ejecta-plume"
[01:19.62]that was monitored by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, or LRO.
[01:25.58]Scientists analyzed the findings,
[01:27.98]and preliminary results from this mission suggested
[01:32.35]that there was some form of water on the moon.
[01:35.96]NASA lunar scientist Michael Wargo said those days
[01:40.71]that a wave of findings during the past year makes it certain.
[01:46.24]"We've confirmed that there was indeed water ice in the ejecta-plume,
[01:52.08]and at an abundance that was about 50 percent
[01:55.39]greater than our initial estimates."
[01:57.42]That means that the impact site has more water than some deserts on Earth.
[02:03.81]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[02:09.66]1. According to the news report, what has happened last October?
[02:30.37]2. What did preliminary results from this mission suggest?
[02:52.65]News Report Two
[02:54.22]An American government panel has recommended that pregnant women,
[02:58.85]health-care workers, children and young adults up to the age of 24
[03:04.62]should get priority for the flu vaccine released later this year.
[03:09.01]But the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
[03:12.90]conceded the policy may change if not enough vaccine
[03:16.88]is produced by October.
[03:18.78]Doctor Ann Schuchat of the Center for Disease Control said
[03:22.98]it is vital for pregnant women
[03:24.71]who have breathing illness and fever to get early treatment.
[03:28.64]We think some suitable medicines for them can be lifesaving,
[03:32.56]and that's a very important message.
[03:34.81]We also think it is important for them
[03:36.84]to get seasonal influenza vaccine,
[03:39.49]and today the committee recommended that
[03:41.85]when vaccine is available,
[03:43.83]and we have a decision to go forward that the pregnant women
[03:47.33]really out of consider getting the H1N1 vaccine.
[03:52.70]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[03:58.19]3. Who are less necessary to receive the flu vaccinations?
[04:21.05]4. Why do pregnant women enjoy the top priority to get vaccine?
[04:43.33]News Report Three
[04:46.12]Hundreds of residents and holidaymakers
[04:48.87]along southern Australia's popular Great Ocean Road
[04:52.90]were forced to move out on Thursday as hot,
[04:56.55]windy weather threatened to recharge bushfires
[05:00.12]that destroyed more than 100 homes on Christmas Day.
[05:04.16]Residents in three coastal towns in the popular holiday area
[05:09.41]were advised to leave their homes as temperatures
[05:12.58]were forecast to reach a high of almost 40 degrees Celsius.
[05:17.41]The hot summer weather threatened to expand fires
[05:21.36]that have been burning for almost two weeks.
[05:24.78]The fires were started by a lightning strike on Dec. 19
[05:29.55]and continue to burn and spread.
[05:32.63]The Country Fire Authority estimates the fire
[05:35.92]has burnt out more than 25 square kilometers of land.
[05:40.53]Authorities estimate that 116 homes
[05:44.00]were destroyed by the fires on Christmas Day.
[05:47.23]The Great Ocean Road is one of Australia's biggest tourist
[05:52.11]draws with its spectacular scenery
[05:55.23]and unusual offshore rock formations.
[05:58.51]Parts of the road remained closed to traffic on Thursday
[06:02.77]during what is typically one of its busiest times of the year.
[06:07.46]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[06:12.78]5. What happened on Australia's Great Ocean Road on Thursday?
[06:34.53]6. Why should the local residents leave their homes?
[06:54.82]7. When did the bushfires start?
[07:14.46]Section B
[07:16.22]Directions: In this section,
[07:18.64]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:21.12]At the end of each conversation,
[07:23.29]you will hear four questions.
[07:25.11]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:27.72]will be spoken only once.
[07:30.09]After you hear a question,
[07:31.61]you must choose the best answer
[07:33.68]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:39.38]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:42.70]with a single line through the centre.
[07:47.02]Conversation One
[07:49.26]W: Are you all ready for Christmas?
[07:51.29]M: No, I haven't even started.
[07:54.63]I've done zero shopping.
[07:56.61]W: Well, you'd better get going.
[07:59.55]Christmas is only a week away.
[08:01.67]M: I have to tell you that I'm one of those people
[08:05.08]who really get stressed out by the Christmas rush.
[08:08.45]W: Oh, I'm not. I love the holidays.
[08:11.48]I love the crowds, the shopping, the holidays, the music,
[08:15.78]the food, the parties, and all the presents.
[08:20.07]M: That's just the beginning.
[08:22.32]My wife always spends too much money on Christmas.
[08:26.64]That takes me till April to pay off all our Christmas bills.
[08:31.08]W: Don't be a miser about it.
[08:33.38]Think about your kids.
[08:34.79]Didn't you use to love Christmas when you were a kid?
[08:38.32]M: I guess so. I don't remember.
[08:42.00]W: I know you did. You know, maybe Christmas is for kids,
[08:47.28]but you can still enjoy it through the eyes of your children.
[08:49.88]M: Well, kids enjoy it because they don't have to do all the shopping
[08:54.64]and pay all the bills.
[08:56.19]W: Maybe that's true. But you know as well as I do,
[09:00.83]that Christmas is more than shopping and trees.
[09:03.94]It's about what's in your heart and how you can make others happy.
[09:08.22]M: You're right. You're absolutely right.
[09:10.92]I'm going to try harder to be nice to people
[09:14.06]and try to keep the true spirit of Christmas in my heart.
[09:18.47]W: I'm glad to hear it.
[09:19.89]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:26.36]8. What does the woman try to do in the conversation?
[09:47.30]9. When does the conversation take place?
[10:08.32]10. What is the man's feeling about Christmas?
[10:27.86]11. What will the man most probably do after the conversation?
[10:51.05]Conversation Two
[10:53.26]W: It's a lovely day today!
[10:55.02]What would you like to do?
[10:56.70]M: I really feel like doing something outdoors.
[10:59.84]Perhaps we could go hill walking?
[11:02.77]W: Mm, I'm not really in the mood for hill walking.
[11:07.44]Why don't we just go swimming?
[11:09.30]M: That suits me.
[11:11.18]But it will take an hour or two.
[11:13.85]Do you like to do something else first?
[11:16.15]Maybe we could go cycling?
[11:18.55]W: I don't think I enjoy that very much.
[11:22.10]Actually I'm not a good cyclist.
[11:25.54]Maybe we could have a meal at the new Italian restaurant.
[11:29.46]M: That's fine for me. I haven't been to that restaurant yet.
[11:34.27]So that's decided then.
[11:35.92]A meal at the new Italian restaurant, then go to swim.
[11:39.97]Great! So, when should we meet?
[11:43.07]W: We'd better get to the restaurant a bit early
[11:45.58]because it might be very busy.
[11:47.55]I think we need to get there by 11:00.
[11:50.63]M: Er, can we make it a little later, say, 11:20?
[11:56.58]I have to visit my grandma this morning
[11:59.35]and I don't think I can make it by then.
[12:02.32]W: No problem. I'll go straight to the restaurant
[12:04.88]at 11:00 and get you a table.
[12:07.20]M: Great!
[12:08.48]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:13.97]12. Why doesn't the man want to go swimming?
[12:35.82]13. What will the two speakers do first?
[12:55.91]14. What can be inferred about the restaurant mentioned?
[13:17.49]15. Why can't the man meet the woman at 11:00?
[13:40.44]Section C
[13:41.94]Directions: In this section,
[13:44.11]you will hear three passages.
[13:46.02]At the end of each passage,
[13:47.72]you will hear three or four questions.
[13:50.62]Both the passage and the questions
[13:52.87]will be spoken only once.
[13:55.12]After you hear a question,
[13:57.27]you must choose the best answer
[13:59.32]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:04.02]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:07.92]with a single line through the centre.
[14:11.37]Passage One
[14:12.77]Twin sisters are supposed to be very much alike, are they not?
[14:18.11]Well, my twin sister Jane and I do look alike,
[14:23.81]however, we are different in many ways.
[14:27.59]We like very different styles of clothing.
[14:30.83]I prefer to dress informally, whereas my twin sister dresses like
[14:37.07]a model,
[14:37.87]always wearing the latest fashions.
[14:41.28]We have very similar character in most ways.
[14:45.30]I do not get angry easily and enjoy being with friends,
[14:49.89]and in these respects, my twin sister feels the same.
[14:55.18]But she likes loud music and modern dances,
[14:59.11]while I find that nightclubs give me a headache.
[15:02.52]She is always with friends, is a favorite with all the teachers,
[15:07.46]and never wants to have any children,
[15:10.96]whereas I prefer to be alone at times,
[15:13.90]don't really try to impress my teachers
[15:17.07]and intend some day to have a family of my own.
[15:21.68]We have tried to live in the same room several times,
[15:25.20]and even agreed on the color we like best, and the kind of
[15:29.64]furniture we want,
[15:31.15]but I like to keep things neat and orderly,
[15:34.30]while my twin sister acts as if there were a servant around to
[15:38.67]pick up all the things
[15:40.19]that get thrown on the floor.
[15:42.30]I like to go to bed early and get up early.
[15:45.76]In contrast, she doesn't seem to have any definite habits,
[15:50.89]often goes to bed very late, and then sleeps late the next day.
[15:57.45]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:03.98]16. What kind of clothes does the speaker like?
[16:23.63]17. What do the twin sisters have in common?
[16:43.59]18. Why isn't the speaker likely to live in the same room with
[16:52.30]her sister?
[17:08.32]Passage Two
[17:09.93]Until the twentieth century cigarettes were not an important
[17:13.84]threat to public health.
[17:16.94]Since the cigarette industry began in the 1870s,
[17:20.68]however, the cigarette-manufacturing machine has developed rapidly.
[17:26.30]This made it possible to produce great numbers of cigarettes very quickly,
[17:32.63]and it reduced the price.
[17:35.09]Today cigarette smoking is a widespread habit.
[17:38.95]About forty-three percent of the men and thirty-one percent of
[17:43.98]the adult women
[17:45.14]in the United States smoke cigarettes regularly.
[17:49.52]It is encouraging to note,
[17:51.47]however, that millions of people have given up the smoking habit.
[17:56.48]Income, education and occupation all play a part
[18:01.14]in determining a person's smoking habits.
[18:04.16]City people smoke more than people living on farms.
[18:07.92]Well-educated men with high income are less likely to smoke cigarettes
[18:14.38]than men with fewer years of schooling and lower incomes.
[18:19.03]On the other hand, if a well-educated man with a high income
[18:23.76]smokes at all,
[18:25.17]he is likely to smoke more packs of cigarettes per day.
[18:29.80]The situation is somewhat different for women.
[18:32.71]There are slightly more smokers among women
[18:36.07]with higher family income and higher education
[18:39.47]than among the lower income and lower education groups.
[18:44.28]These more highly educated women tend to smoke more heavily.
[18:48.64]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:54.99]19. What reduced the price of cigarettes?
[19:16.56]20. What is the percentage of American adult women who smoke regularly?
[19:39.32]21. What plays a part in determining a person's smoking habit?
[20:00.77]22. Which of the following is true according to the passage?
[20:23.34]Passage Three
[20:25.06]Life on earth depends on the sun.
[20:27.73]Day after day we see its light and feel its warmth,
[20:32.52]but we do not often consider their origin.
[20:36.49]Yet there are many remarkable things about the sun.
[20:40.17]One is its distance from the earth.
[20:42.71]This is about 93 million miles.
[20:46.76]A journey of this distance, even if it could be made,
[20:51.01]would take several hundred years even in the fastest rocket.
[20:56.27]The sun makes us feel hot,
[20:58.58]even at a distance of 93 million miles.
[21:02.30]This is not surprising.
[21:04.26]The temperature on the sun is about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
[21:09.93]But we receive only a small part of the heat.
[21:13.43]The total heat of the sun could melt a column of ice
[21:17.32]two and a quarter miles thick and 93 million miles high in a second.
[21:24.43]The brightness of the sun is equally astonishing.
[21:28.71]As we said earlier, we receive only a very small part of the sun's heat.
[21:35.01]We also receive only a very small part of its light.
[21:38.57]This is sufficient for the growth of trees and plants,
[21:42.33]and for the existence of living creatures on the earth.
[21:46.26]Too much heat and light would destroy the balance of life.
[21:49.93]The heat and light from the sun come in just the right quantities
[21:54.58]for life on earth.
[21:57.89]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:03.01]23. What remarkable things are mentioned in the passage?
[22:26.06]24. What is the temperature on the sun?
[22:47.04]25. Which of the following is true according to the passage?
[23:08.38]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

[00:44.72]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:48.26]with a single line through the centre.
[00:51.30]News Report One
[00:53.34]A message in a bottle sent out to sea
[00:55.88]by a New Hampshire man more than five decades ago
[01:00.16]was found 1,500 miles away
[01:03.80]and has been returned to his daughter.
[01:06.95]The long lost message was discovered by Clint Buffington of Utah
[01:11.58]while he was vacationing.
[01:14.46]Buffington says he found a soda bottle half-buried in the sand
[01:18.95]that looked like it had been there
[01:21.34]since the beginning of time.
[01:23.90]The note inside the bottle said,
[01:26.94]"Return to 419 Ocean Street and receive a reward of $150
[01:33.11]from Richard and Tina Pierce,
[01:35.44]owners of the Beachcomber motel.
[01:39.53]"The motel was owned by the parents of Paula Pierce in 1960.
[01:44.30]Her father had written the note as a joke
[01:47.15]and had thrown it into the Atlantic Ocean.
[01:50.29]Buffington flew to New Hampshire
[01:52.63]to deliver the message to Paula Pierce.
[01:56.17]She held up to her father's promise
[01:58.41]giving Buffington that reward,
[02:00.70]but the biggest reward is
[02:02.54]the message in a bottle finding its way back home.
[02:07.37]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[02:14.10]1. What is the news report mainly about?
[02:33.22]2. Why did Paula Pierce give Clint Buffington the reward?
[02:51.76]News Report Two
[02:54.24]Millions of bees have died in South Carolina
[02:57.73]during aerial insects spraying operations
[03:00.92]that were carried out to combat the Zika virus.
[03:04.71]The insects spraying over the weekend
[03:07.11]left more than 2 million bees dead on the spot
[03:10.50]in Dorchester County, South Carolina,
[03:13.24]where four travel-related cases of Zika disease
[03:16.38]have been confirmed in the area.
[03:19.32]Most of the death came from Flowertown Bee Farm,
[03:23.10]a company in Summerville that sells bees and honey products.
[03:27.73]Juanita Stanley, who owns the company,
[03:30.57]said the farm"looks like it's been destroyed."
[03:33.97]The farm lost about 2.5 million bees.
[03:38.89]Dorchester County officials apologized for
[03:42.14]the accidental mass killing of bees.
[03:45.33]"Dorchester County is aware
[03:46.88]that some beekeepers in the area
[03:49.32]that was sprayed on Sunday
[03:50.78]lost their bee colonies,"
[03:53.58]County manager Jason Ward said in a statement.
[03:57.41]"I am not pleased that so many bees were killed."
[04:01.39]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[04:08.12]3. Why were spraying operations carried out in Dorchester County?
[04:27.89]4. What does the news report say about Flowertown Bee Farm?
[04:46.49]News Report Three
[04:49.45]The world's largest aircraft
[04:51.12]has taken to the skies for the first time.
[04:55.30]The Airlander 10 spent nearly two hours in the air,
[04:58.89]having taken off from Cardington Airfield in Bedfordshire.
[05:03.67]During its flight,
[05:05.01]it reached 3,000 feet and performed a series of gentle turns
[05:10.34]all over a safe area.
[05:13.13]The aircraft is massive
[05:15.37]---as long as a football field
[05:17.26]and as tall as six double decker buses
[05:20.20]and capable of flying for up to five days.
[05:24.68]It was first developed for the US government
[05:27.53]as a long-range spy aircraft
[05:30.11]but was abandoned following budget cutbacks.
[05:33.82]The aircraft cost 25 million pounds
[05:37.70]and can carry heavier loads than huge jet planes
[05:41.83]while also producing less noise and emitting less pollution.
[05:46.81]The makers believe it's the future of aircraft,
[05:50.36]and one day we'll be using them to go places.
[05:54.54]But there's still a long way to go.
[05:58.17]The Airlander will need to have 200 hours' flying time
[06:01.80]before being allowed to fly by the aviation administration.
[06:06.14]If it passes though,
[06:08.53]we can hope we'll all get some extra leg room.
[06:12.41]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[06:19.48]5. What do we learn about the first flight of the Airlander 10?
[06:39.40]6. What caused the US government to abandon the Airlander 10
[06:43.83]as a spy aircraft?
[07:01.56]7. What is the advantage of the Airlander 10 over huge jet planes?
[07:21.19]Section B
[07:22.80]Directions: In this section,
[07:25.70]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:28.98]At the end of each conversation,
[07:30.83]you will hear four questions.
[07:33.73]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[07:39.25]After you hear a question,
[07:41.21]you must choose the best answer
[07:43.06]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:48.45]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:52.45]with a single line through the centre.
[07:55.68]Conversation One
[07:58.42]M: Do you feel like going out tonight?
[08:00.61]W: Yeah, why not?
[08:02.35]We haven't been out for ages. What's on?
[08:05.84]M: Well, there is a film about climate change.
[08:08.09]Does it sound good to you?
[08:09.89]W: Oh, not really.
[08:11.88]It doesn't really appeal to me.
[08:14.23]What's it about, just climate change?
[08:17.21]M: I think it is about how climate change affects everyday life.
[08:21.09]I wonder how they make it entertaining.
[08:23.43]W: Well, it sounds really awful.
[08:25.94]It's an important subject, I agree.
[08:28.48]But I'm not in the mood for anything depressing.
[08:30.92]What else is on?
[08:32.86]M: There is a Spanish dance festival.
[08:35.00]W: Oh, I love dance.
[08:36.54]That sounds really interesting.
[08:39.38]M: Apparently, it's absolutely brilliant.
[08:41.87]Let's see what it says in the paper:
[08:44.52]Anna Gomez leads in an exciting production
[08:47.26]of the great Spanish love story---Carmen.
[08:50.89]W: OK. Then what time is it on?
[08:53.04]M: At 7:30.
[08:54.54]W: Well, that's no good.
[08:56.08]We haven't got enough time to get there.
[08:58.47]Is there anything else?
[09:00.36]M: There is a comedy special on.
[09:02.45]W: Where is it on?
[09:04.05]M: It's at the city theater.
[09:05.94]It's a charity comedy night with lots of different acts.
[09:08.98]It looks pretty good.
[09:10.93]The critic in the local paper says
[09:13.37]it's the funniest thing he's ever seen.
[09:15.41]It says here:
[09:16.90]Roger Whitehead is an amazing host
[09:19.14]to a night of fun performances.
[09:22.23]W: Um, I'm not keen on him.
[09:24.44]He is not very funny.
[09:26.77]M: Are you sure you fancy going out tonight?
[09:29.01]You are not very enthusiastic.
[09:31.05]W: Perhaps you're right.
[09:32.92]OK, let's go see the dance.
[09:35.95]But tomorrow, not tonight.
[09:38.19]M: Great, I'll book the tickets online.
[09:41.57]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:47.45]8. What does the woman think of climate change?
[10:06.30]9. Why do the speakers give up
[10:09.23]going to the Spanish dance festival tonight?
[10:27.46]10. What does the critic say about the comedy performed
[10:30.40]at the city theater?
[10:48.27]11.What does the woman decide to do tomorrow?
[11:05.72]Conversation Two
[11:07.91]W: Good morning, Mr. Lee.
[11:09.95]May I have a minute of your time?
[11:12.55]M: Sure, Catherine. What can I do for you?
[11:15.39]W: I'm quite anxious about transferring over to your college.
[11:18.89]I'm afraid I won't fit in.
[11:21.58]M: Don't worry, Catherine.
[11:22.92]It's completely normal for you
[11:24.61]to be nervous about transferring schools.
[11:27.35]This happens to many transfer students.
[11:29.69]W: Yes, I know.
[11:31.18]But I'm younger than most of the students in my year
[11:34.23]and that worries me a lot.
[11:37.28]M: Well, you may be the only younger one in your year.
[11:40.21]But you know,
[11:41.91]we have a lot of after-school activities
[11:44.64]you can join in. And so, this way,
[11:47.73]you'll be able to meet new friends of different age groups.
[11:50.92]W: That's nice.
[11:52.31]I love games and hobby groups.
[11:54.50]M: I'm sure you do.
[11:56.14]So you'll be just fine.
[11:58.83]Don't worry so much and try to make the most of
[12:00.87]what we have on offer here.
[12:03.97]Also, remember that
[12:05.52]you can come to me anytime of the day
[12:07.57]if you need help.
[12:09.01]W: Thanks so much.
[12:10.71]I definitely feel better now.
[12:12.80]As a matter of fact,
[12:14.65]I've already contacted one of the girls
[12:17.28]who'd be living in the same house with me.
[12:19.37]And she seems really nice.
[12:21.76]I guess living on campus
[12:23.85]I'll have a chance to have a close circle of friends
[12:26.89]since we'll be living together.
[12:29.64]M: All students are very friendly with new arrivals.
[12:32.97]Let me check who'd be living with you in your flat.
[12:36.78]OK, there are Hanna, Kelly and Bree.
[12:40.37]Bree is also a new student here like you.
[12:43.62]I'm sure you two will have more to share with each other.
[12:47.70]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:55.08]12. Why does Catherine feel anxious?
[13:13.41]13. What does Mr. Lee encourage Catherine to do?
[13:32.63]14. What does Mr. Lee promise to do for Catherine?
[13:52.75]15. What do we learn about Catherine's schoolmate Bree?
[14:09.82]Section C
[14:12.32]Directions: In this section,
[14:14.86]you will hear three passages.
[14:17.16]At the end of each passage,
[14:19.16]you will hear three or four questions.
[14:22.79]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[14:27.63]After you hear a question,
[14:29.37]you must choose the best answer
[14:31.12]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:37.25]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:41.23]with a single line through the centre.
[14:44.32]Passage One
[14:46.02]Have you ever felt like you would do just about anything
[14:49.36]to satisfy your hunger?
[14:51.95]A new study in mice may help to explain
[14:54.94]why hunger can feel like such a powerful motivating force.
[14:59.52]In the study,
[15:01.26]researchers found that hunger outweighed other physical drives,
[15:05.34]including fear, thirst and social needs.
[15:09.83]To determine which feeling won out,
[15:12.97]the researchers did a series of experiments.
[15:15.96]In one experiment,
[15:17.80]the mice were both hungry and thirsty.
[15:20.75]When given the choice of either eating food or drinking water,
[15:24.33]the mice went for the food,
[15:25.92]the researchers found.
[15:28.68]However, when the mice were well-fed but thirsty,
[15:32.11]they opted to drink, according to the study.
[15:35.74]In the second experiment
[15:37.88]meant to pit the mice's hunger against their fear,
[15:40.98]hungry mice were placed in a cage
[15:43.82]that had certain "fox-scented" areas
[15:46.76]and other places that smelled safer
[15:49.75](in other words, not like an animal that could eat them)
[15:53.18]but also had food.
[15:55.87]It turned out that,
[15:57.41]when the mice were hungry,
[15:59.16]they ventured into the unsafe areas for food.
[16:02.50]But when the mice were well-fed,
[16:04.24]they stayed in areas of the cage
[16:06.63]that were considered "safe".
[16:09.32]Hunger also outweighed the mice's social needs,
[16:12.61]the researchers found.
[16:14.76]Mice are usually social animals
[16:17.21]and prefer to be in the company of other mice,
[16:20.10]according to the study.
[16:22.10]When the mice were hungry,
[16:23.79]they opted to leave the company of other mice to go get food.
[16:29.51]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:36.63]16. What is the researchers' purpose
[16:38.92]in carrying out the series of experiments with mice?
[16:58.16]17. In what circumstances do mice venture into unsafe areas?
[17:19.13]18. What is said about mice at the end of the passage?
[17:38.85]Passage Two
[17:41.64]The United States has one of the best highway systems
[17:45.43]in the world.
[17:46.82]Interstate Highways connect just about
[17:49.36]every large and midsized city in the country.
[17:53.34]Did you ever wonder
[17:54.94]why such a complete system of excellent roads exists.
[17:58.93]For an answer,
[18:00.72]you would have to go back to the early 1920s.
[18:05.00]In those years, just after World War I,
[18:08.09]the military wanted to build an American highway system
[18:12.22]for national defense.
[18:14.21]Such a system could,
[18:16.05]if necessary,
[18:17.31]move troops quickly from one area to another.
[18:21.30]It could also get people out of cities in danger of being bombed.
[18:26.08]So-called roads of national importance were designated
[18:30.12]but they were mostly small country roads.
[18:33.41]In 1944,
[18:35.50]Congress passed a bill to upgrade the system
[18:39.03]but did not fund the plan right away.
[18:42.42]In the 1950s,
[18:44.56]the plan began to become a reality.
[18:47.05]Over 25 billion dollars was appropriated by Congress
[18:51.83]and construction began on about 40,000 miles of new roads.
[18:57.90]The idea was to connect the new system to
[19:01.09]existing expressways and freeways.
[19:04.68]And though the system was built mostly to make car travel easier,
[19:09.27]defense was not forgotten.
[19:11.06]For instance,
[19:12.85]highway overpasses had to be high enough to
[19:16.44]allow trailers carrying military missiles to pass under them.
[19:20.37]By 1974,
[19:23.11]the system was mostly completed.
[19:26.09]A few additional roads would come later.
[19:29.48]Quick and easy travel between all parts of the country
[19:32.86]was now possible.
[19:35.11]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:42.19]19. What does the speaker say about the American highway system?
[20:03.40]20. What was the original purpose of building a highway system?
[20:24.03]21. When was the Interstate Highway System mostly completed?
[20:42.91]Passage Three
[20:44.95]Texting while driving was listed as a major cause of road deaths
[20:49.90]among young Americans back in 2013.
[20:54.48]A recent study said that 40% of American teens
[20:59.62]claim to have been in a car
[21:01.61]when the driver used a cell phone in a way
[21:04.30]that put people in danger.
[21:06.59]This sounds like a widespread decease
[21:09.53]---but it's one that technology may now help to cure.
[21:13.46]T.J. Everts, a 20-year-old inventor,
[21:17.34]has come up with a novel solution
[21:19.09]that could easily put texting drivers on notice.
[21:23.07]It's called Smart Wheel,
[21:26.16]and it is designed
[21:27.40]to fit over the steering wheel of most standard vehicles
[21:32.74]to track whether or not the driver has two hands
[21:35.77]on the wheel at all times.
[21:38.46]Everts' invention warns the drivers
[21:41.20]with a light and a sound
[21:43.34]when they hold the wheel with one hand only.
[21:46.33]But as soon as they place the other hand back on the wheel
[21:49.42]the light turns back to green and the sound stops.
[21:54.06]It also watches for what's called "close-by hands,"
[21:57.75]where both hands are close together near the top of the wheel
[22:02.48]so the driver can type with both thumbs and drive at the same time.
[22:07.95]All the data Smart Wheel collects is also sent to a connected app,
[22:13.93]so any parents who install Smart Wheel
[22:17.22]can keep track of the teens' driving habits.
[22:20.51]If they try to remove or damage the cover,
[22:23.70]that's reported as well.
[22:27.03]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:34.26]22. What is a major cause of road deaths among young Americans?
[22:55.14]23. What is Smart Wheel?
[23:14.26]24. What happens if the driver has one hand on the wheel?
[23:34.39]25. How do parents keep track of their teens' driving habits?

[00:16.22]Part II  Listening Comprehension (25 minutes)
[00:19.60]Section A
[00:21.17]Directions: In this section,
[00:23.13]you will hear three news reports.
[00:25.63]At the end of each news report,
[00:27.15]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:30.02]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:34.84]After you hear a question,
[00:36.75]you must choose the best answer
[00:38.51]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:43.90]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:47.26]with a single line through the centre.
[00:50.80]News Report One
[00:53.31]Kelly Swisher,
[00:54.52]an Arkansas woman,
[00:55.87]escaped injury and managed to safely stop her car
[00:59.57]after a four-foot-long rat snake came out
[01:03.02]from under her car's seat and slithered across her feet
[01:06.61]as she was driving down the highway.
[01:10.21]Rat snakes aren't poisonous or a threat to people generally.
[01:14.09]But the woman said the snake she encountered Thursday
[01:17.49]terrified her out of her wits.
[01:20.93]“It was rough with big scales," said Swisher,
[01:24.07]who was on her way to pick up her friend
[01:26.37]at the airport when it happened.
[01:28.67]"I don't know
[01:29.76]whether I had my hands on the steering wheel or not.
[01:33.13]I am not the most flexible person in the world,
[01:36.32]but I can guarantee my knees were up next to my ears."
[01:40.81]She said the snake first slithered back under the seat,
[01:44.51]and she hoped it would stay there
[01:46.46]until she was able to get off the highway and stop.
[01:50.06]"That didn't work out," she said.
[01:52.36]"Here he comes, and he wound up in my back seat
[01:55.67]before I could finally get off the road,
[01:58.22]stop and get out of the car."
[02:00.81]She called for help
[02:02.21]and Washington County Animal Control Officers
[02:04.57]came and captured the snake.
[02:08.71]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[02:14.55]1. How did Kelly Swisher feel when she first came across the rat snake?
[02:35.28]2. What does the report say about the snake?
[02:55.16]News Report Two
[02:57.82]Fast food, it turns out,
[02:59.46]isn't quite as fast as it used to be.
[03:02.47]A new study finds that
[03:04.26]McDonald's posted its slowest drive-through times
[03:07.61]since this survey was first conducted 15 years ago.
[03:11.85]At McDonald's,
[03:13.44]customers will spend on average 3 minutes and 9 seconds
[03:17.88]from the time they place their orders
[03:20.09]until they receive their food.
[03:22.36]That's about 10 seconds more than the industry average---
[03:26.00]and a lot slower than a decade ago,
[03:28.79]according to the study,
[03:30.56]which was commissioned by QSR,
[03:33.09]an industry trade publication.
[03:36.22]And McDonald's wasn't alone in slowing down.
[03:39.38]Other chains also saw their drive-through performance slow down.
[03:43.73]Among the reasons for the slower service:
[03:46.33]Today there are more choices on the menu,
[03:49.41]and the products themselves are more complex
[03:52.27]and take longer to prepare.
[03:54.79]Speed, of course, is essential to the drive-through experience,
[03:58.98]and drive-throughs are hugely important to chains
[04:02.47]such as McDonald's, Burger King and Taco Bell.
[04:06.86]"Usually the drive-through accounts for
[04:09.17]60 to 70 percent of all business
[04:12.76]that goes through a fast-food restaurant,"
[04:15.80]notes Sam Oches, editor of QSR.
[04:19.94]Of course, consumers also want their orders
[04:23.03]prepared correctly and on that score,
[04:25.97]Oches says, "accuracy is still really high."
[04:31.14]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[04:36.27]3. What is the news report mainly about?
[04:54.74]4. What has slowed down McDonald's drive-through service?
[05:14.40]News Report Three
[05:16.46]The first private mission outside of Earth's orbit
[05:19.71]is closer than many of us think.
[05:22.61]U.S. government officials are set to approve a mission
[05:26.31]by privately-held space company, Moon Express,
[05:30.36]to travel outside of Earth's orbit in late 2017.
[05:35.79]Moon Express's mission involves plans
[05:38.38]to land a suitcase-sized package
[05:41.01]of scientific equipment on the moon
[05:43.96]for ongoing exploration and commercial development.
[05:48.25]The decision involved months of lobbying
[05:50.37]and coordinated conversations
[05:52.96]between a number of federal agencies.
[05:56.51]Under international treaties,
[05:58.71]the U.S. is responsible for the cargo
[06:01.32]of both public and private spacecraft.
[06:05.21]This makes commercial space travel a complex legal issue
[06:09.37]not just domestically, but abroad.
[06:12.78]A Moon Express representative declined to comment on this story,
[06:17.23]but noted that the company is "very optimistic" about its proposal.
[06:22.92]Moon Express is not the only company
[06:25.62]seeking for the right to travel to outer space.
[06:29.29]Elon Musk's SpaceX aims to send an unmanned aircraft
[06:34.15]to Mars by 2018.
[06:37.99]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[06:42.99]5. What is the news report mainly about?
[07:01.87]6. What is Moon Express planning to do?
[07:20.89]7. What does Moon Express think of its mission?
[07:39.56]Section B
[07:40.83]Directions: In this section,
[07:43.67]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:46.78]At the end of each conversation,
[07:48.92]you will hear four questions.
[07:51.44]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[07:57.28]After you hear a question,
[07:58.92]you must choose the best answer
[08:00.81]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[08:06.56]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[08:10.53]with a single line through the centre.
[08:13.64]Conversation One
[08:15.63]M: Hey Sophia, how are you doing?
[08:17.78]W: Hi, Bob. I'm good, thanks.
[08:20.07]Actually, I'm on holiday with my family
[08:22.48]in Thailand at the moment,
[08:24.68]although I wish it were with my friends instead.
[08:27.67]M: Really? You never said you were going to Thailand.
[08:31.02]How I envy you!
[08:32.82]W: I've only been here a week,
[08:35.07]but, you know, Thailand's an amazing place.
[08:38.32]I'm having a great time here.
[08:40.81]In fact, I'm now lying on the beach in Phuket.
[08:44.50]I've been in the sun for around 15 minutes only,
[08:48.40]and I'm already getting sun burnt.
[08:50.74]Have you been here before?
[08:52.94]M: No, I wish I had.
[08:54.98]What else have you been doing in Thailand
[08:56.88]besides enjoying the sun?
[08:59.17]W: Well, I met a guy from Germany yesterday.
[09:02.47]He showed me around the orphanage he works at.
[09:05.92]There I met many volunteer teachers
[09:08.43]who are mainly young people from Europe.
[09:11.29]M: Ahh, that's interesting.
[09:13.31]W: Yes. I also made a new little friend, Sarah.
[09:17.34]She was so cute.
[09:19.29]I was so sad when I had to leave at the end of the day.
[09:23.24]If I ever come back to Thailand,
[09:25.48]I'd definitely visit this place again, as a volunteer.
[09:30.06]M: Well, you can tell me all about it when you get back.
[09:33.32]My phone battery is almost dead now.
[09:35.63]Remember to get me something from the souvenir shops.
[09:38.72]I like to collect bits and pieces
[09:40.97]from different parts of the world.
[09:43.21]Bye now. Enjoy yourself, Sophia.
[09:45.61]W: Bye.
[09:48.72]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:53.81]8. What does the woman say she is doing now?
[10:13.08]9. What did the woman do yesterday?
[10:31.10]10. Why does the man have to end the conversation?
[10:50.01]11. Why does the man ask the woman to bring him something from Thailand?
[11:10.45]Conversation Two
[11:13.60]W: Hi, David. There is a new gym opening in town today.
[11:16.50]Would you like to go with me this afternoon?
[11:19.36]M: Yes, more than glad to.
[11:21.21]I haven't been to a gym for ages.
[11:23.42]I need to do some exercise to tone up.
[11:26.37]W: Then this is a good chance.
[11:28.57]They sent me an invitation with a note saying
[11:31.70]I could take a friend for free on the first day.
[11:35.62]Also, if we both sign up before Friday,
[11:38.44]we can get a discount on a six-month membership.
[11:42.04]M: Great. Count me in.
[11:44.25]I really want to lose some of this belly fat
[11:46.51]and turn it into muscle.
[11:48.80]But I'm not sure which of the gym equipment would best help.
[11:52.72]W: Well, I'm no expert of that.
[11:55.33]But I think you can try lifting weights
[11:58.49]and do at least two hundred sit-ups twice a day.
[12:02.15]M: I've never tried weight lifting before. Is it dangerous?
[12:06.87]W: No, not at all, if you know some of the basics.
[12:11.09]Don't worry. I'll show you the ropes.
[12:12.83]I used to practice this at another gym
[12:15.14]before my membership ended.
[12:17.34]I'll be your personal trainer.
[12:20.34]M: Thank you. What other equipment do they have?
[12:23.22]W: Well, like all gyms,
[12:25.78]they have all sorts of things to help build up muscles
[12:29.08]in different parts of the body,
[12:31.60]like upright bicycles,
[12:34.11]chess stretching machines and running machines.
[12:37.98]You could use any of these to suit your purpose.
[12:41.44]Now the gym opens at noon,
[12:45.11]so can we meet up in town at 1:30 pm?
[12:48.70]M: Perfect. See you there, coach.
[12:52.27]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:57.13]12. What are the speakers talking about?
[13:15.55]13. What does the gym offer at its opening?
[13:34.33]14. What is the man concerned about?
[13:53.27]15. What do we learn about the woman from the conversation?
[14:13.20]Section C
[14:14.87]Directions: In this section,
[14:18.97]you will hear three passages.
[14:21.02]At the end of each passage,
[14:23.07]you will hear three or four questions.
[14:26.38]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[14:31.12]After you hear a question,
[14:33.18]you must choose the best answer
[14:34.94]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:40.67]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:44.52]with a single line through the centre.
[14:47.62]Passage One
[14:50.13]In today's job market,
[14:52.17]it's not uncommon for job seekers
[14:53.97]to submit applications for many positions.
[14:57.47]That involves lots of time and lots of work to organize.
[15:02.44]Certainly, you don't want to waste your precious hours
[15:05.04]on following the developments in a disorderly fashion
[15:09.09]and miss important deadlines,
[15:11.48]confuse interview times,
[15:13.29]or forget to follow up as a result.
[15:16.85]Accordingly,managing your job search properly
[15:20.24]is just as important as
[15:22.05]identifying job opportunities and submitting your applications.
[15:26.88]If you're familiar with Microsoft Excel or a similar program,
[15:31.71]creating a table is a simple and effective way
[15:35.32]to keep track of your job applications.
[15:38.15]If Excel isn't quite your cup of tea, don't worry.
[15:42.61]You can create a table in Microsoft Word
[15:45.56]or a similar word processor.
[15:48.22]Google is another tool to help you get organized effectively.
[15:53.17]If you have a G-mail account,
[15:55.58]you can create, save and send tables
[15:58.89]in addition to written documents,
[16:01.08]like your cover letter and resume.
[16:03.98]You can also link up with Google calendar
[16:07.23]to make sure you stay on top of important dates.
[16:11.40]Clearly, there are plenty of ways
[16:13.65]to keep track of your job search
[16:15.70]and making the effort to simplify your job search will pay off.
[16:20.91]Nevertheless, you should always focus on quality, not quantity:
[16:26.75]only apply for positions you're qualified for
[16:30.20]and make each application count,
[16:33.07]personalizing each cover letter
[16:35.13]and updating and editing your resume.
[16:38.87]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:43.37]16. What does the speaker say about today's job seekers?
[17:03.39]17. What can job applicants do with the help of Google?
[17:23.23]18. What does the speaker suggest job seekers do?
[17:42.99]Passage Two
[17:45.24]Some people say if kids didn't have to go to school,
[17:48.92]they'd all be out in the streets.
[17:51.37]My reply is: No, they wouldn't.
[17:54.56]First, even if schools stayed just the way they are,
[17:58.70]children would spend at least some time there
[18:01.95]because that's where they'd be likely to find friends.
[18:05.90]Second, schools wouldn't stay
[18:08.21]the way they are.
[18:09.46]They'd get better
[18:10.76]because we would have to start making them
[18:13.70]what they ought to be right now.
[18:16.59]Last, if we stirred up our brains and gave children a little help,
[18:21.90]those who did not want to go to school
[18:24.30]could find other things to do---
[18:26.94]things many children now do during their holidays.
[18:31.43]There is something easier we could do.
[18:34.78]We need to get kids out of the school buildings,
[18:38.22]give them a chance to learn about the world at first hand.
[18:42.62]In Philadelphia and Portland, Oregon,
[18:45.46]plans are being drawn up for public schools
[18:48.21]that won't have any school buildings at all.
[18:51.77]That would take the students out into the city
[18:54.91]and help them to use it and its people as a resource.
[18:59.55]In other words,
[19:01.05]students, perhaps in groups, perhaps independently,
[19:05.18]will go to libraries, museums, exhibitions, courtrooms,
[19:10.43]radio and TV stations, meetings, businesses and laboratories
[19:15.82]to learn about their world and society at first hand.
[19:20.65]A small private school in Washington is already doing this.
[19:24.75]It makes sense. We need more of it.
[19:29.04]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:34.87]19. What are some people worried about according to the speaker?
[19:54.65]20. What does the speaker think we could do for kids who dislike school?
[20:15.57]21. What does the speaker say is the easier thing we could do?
[20:36.84]Passage Three
[20:38.94]Before there was the written word,
[20:40.59]there was the language of dance.
[20:43.19]Dance expresses love and hate,
[20:46.34]joy and sorrow, life and death,
[20:49.21]and everything else in between.
[20:51.91]Dance in America is everywhere.
[20:54.66]We dance from Florida to Alaska,
[20:57.46]from horizon to horizon and coast to coast.
[21:01.21]We dance at weddings, birthdays, office parties
[21:04.93]or just to fill the time.
[21:07.53]"I adore dancing," says Lester Bridges,
[21:10.84]the owner of a dance studio in a small town in Iowa.
[21:15.21]"I can't imagine doing anything else with my life."
[21:19.01]Bridges runs dance classes for all ages.
[21:22.14]"Teaching dance is wonderful.
[21:25.53]My older students say it makes them feel young.
[21:29.03]It's marvellous to watch them.
[21:30.79]For many of them,
[21:32.38]it's a way of meeting people and having a social life."
[21:36.19]So why do we dance?
[21:38.69]"I can tell you about one young couple,"says Bridges.
[21:42.60]"They arrive at the class in a bad mood
[21:45.21]and they leave with a smile.
[21:47.97]Dancing seems to change their mood completely."
[21:52.75]So, do we dance in order to make ourselves
[21:55.90]feel better, calmer, healthier?
[21:59.39]Andrea Hillier, a dance teacher says,
[22:02.81]"Dance, like the rhythm of a beating heart, is life.
[22:06.71]Even after all these years,
[22:08.45]I want to get better and better.
[22:11.51]I keep practicing even when I'm exhausted.
[22:14.92]I find it hard to stop!
[22:17.83]Dancing reminds me I'm alive."
[22:21.89]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:28.64]22. What does the passage say about dance in America?
[22:47.80]23. What do we know about Lester Bridges' dance studio?
[23:07.93]24. What happened to the young couple after they attended Lester Bridges' class?
[23:28.97]25. What did Andrea Hillier say about dancing?
[23:49.88]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

[00:15.06]College English Test - Band 4
[00:18.62]Part II Listening Comprehension
[00:22.63]Section A
[00:24.55]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.42]you will hear three news reports.
[00:29.93]At the end of each news report,
[00:31.84]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:34.56]Both the news report and the questions
[00:36.57]will be spoken only once.
[00:39.18]After you hear a question,
[00:41.08]you must choose the best answer
[00:42.54]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:47.47]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:50.87]with a single line through the centre.
[00:54.03]News Report One
[00:56.69]The United States government has announced the plans
[00:59.06]that it says will ensure that the all traffic on the Internet
[01:02.33]is treated equally
[01:04.00]regardless of how much behind with it to take up.
[01:07.67]The head of Federal Communications Commission
[01:10.48]Julius Genachowski said
[01:13.06]it is vital to guarantee open and neutral Internet.
[01:17.79]In the major speech to a Washington think tank
[01:20.81]Julius Genachowski outlined the roadmap for all operators
[01:25.37]including wireless to follow.
[01:28.21]He is meant to ensure that the Internet service providers
[01:31.72]cannot block or slow down Internet traffic
[01:35.03]like the ban with excessive video downloads.
[01:38.60]Mr. Genachowski's move to extend the rules to wireless
[01:42.60]aims to make more people get online using a mobile phone.
[01:47.67]Gigi Sohn of public knowledge
[01:50.28]backs the inclusion of wireless operators
[01:53.21]because she says wireless is the next frontier
[01:56.63]and where the great growth of Internet accesses
[01:59.20]is going to come from.
[02:01.38]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[02:06.82]1. What is the purpose of government's proposals
[02:11.19]in the United States?
[02:27.66]2. What can we learn about Genachowski's speech
[02:32.54]from the news?

[02:49.02]News Report Two
[02:51.07]NATO troops in Afghanistan have rescued a reporter
[02:55.19]of the New York Times newspaper
[02:57.49]who had been held by the Taliban
[02:59.41]in the northern province of Kunduz since Saturday.
[03:03.83]The New York Times said the journalist Stephen Farrell
[03:07.70]was unharmed after being released in the gun battle.
[03:11.82]A military operation led by NATO forces
[03:15.21]rescued Stephen Farrell from a village
[03:17.78]in the northern province of Kunduz
[03:20.59]where he had been kidnapped last week
[03:23.04]while reporting on the consequence of a NATO airstrike.
[03:27.07]In remarks quoted on the New York Times website
[03:30.64]he says he heard British and Afghan voices
[03:34.00]as bullets started flying around.
[03:37.17]That suggests that British troops
[03:39.48]were involved in the rescue
[03:41.36]although there has been no confirmation of that.
[03:44.64]Stephen Farrell's colleague Sultan Munadi,
[03:47.91]an Afghan interpreter
[03:49.37]who's worked for the New York Times for several years
[03:52.64]was killed in the exchange of fire.
[03:56.11]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[04:02.54]3. What do we learn about the journalist Stephen Farrell
[04:07.94]from the news?
[04:24.22]4. When did the Afghan interpreter Sultan Munadi
[04:29.63]lose his life?

[04:46.20]News Report Three
[04:48.53]At the heart of the dispute
[04:49.90]is whether food aid to developing countries
[04:52.51]should be in the form of cash or agricultural products,
[04:56.08]often subsidized by donors.
[04:58.99]The European Union argues
[05:00.64]that cash donations are the best way
[05:03.00]to quickly purchase food in an emergency
[05:06.41]because food shipments are sometimes sold
[05:08.58]in local markets at the receiving end.
[05:11.75]And European countries say
[05:13.57]flooding markets with cheap imported food
[05:16.08]drives local farmers out of business.
[05:19.35]Edward Clay, Senior Research Associate
[05:22.22]at the Overseas Development Institute in London
[05:25.59]says the European approach makes food aid more flexible.
[05:29.87]The United States argues
[05:31.79]that the European cash-only approach has been ineffective,
[05:35.76]causing a steep decline in food aid since the 1990s.
[05:40.74]According to a report published by the World Food Program,
[05:45.33]food aid contributions suffered
[05:47.41]a 1 billion dollar shortfall last year.
[05:50.84]In contrast, the U.S. sends donations to developing countries
[05:54.95]in the form of corn, wheat and other commodities.
[05:59.42]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[06:04.86]5. What is the dispute between the European Union
[06:09.88]and the United States?
[06:26.63]6. Why is the European Union in favor of cash donations?
[06:47.99]7. What does the United States think of the European approach?
[07:09.59]Section B
[07:11.40]Directions: In this section,
[07:14.11]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:16.93]At the end of each conversation,
[07:18.50]you will hear four questions.
[07:21.08]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:23.23]will be spoken only once.
[07:25.56]After you hear a question,
[07:27.42]you must choose the best answer
[07:29.04]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:34.84]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:38.27]with a single line through the centre.
[07:41.68]Conversation One
[07:44.25]M: Hays Employment Agency, good morning.
[07:46.71]W: Good morning. I wonder if you can help me.
[07:49.63]I'm looking for a job.
[07:51.36]M: I'll see what we can do.
[07:52.98]Err, have you been to us before?
[07:55.33]W: No, but you've managed to get jobs for some of my friends.
[07:59.36]So I thought, perhaps, you know...
[08:02.08]M: Yes, I see. First of all, could you give me your full name?
[08:06.39]W: Yes, of course. Susan Horus.
[08:09.41]M: Good. And could I have your phone number?
[08:11.96]W: Yes, 7788992.
[08:17.19]M: Fine. And your date of birth, please?
[08:20.02]W: February 3rd, 1980.
[08:22.88]M: Thank you. Now, education. Which school did you go to?
[08:27.30]W: I went to a secondary school in South Town.
[08:30.56]M: And have you been to college?
[08:32.22]W: No, I left full time education when I was 18.
[08:36.03]M: I see. Any qualifications?
[08:38.59]W: Yes. I gained a shorthand and typing diploma at evening classes.
[08:43.70]M: That's good. Now where are you working at the moment?
[08:47.43]W: Well, I've got a job as the shorthand-typist.
[08:51.14]But I'm not enjoying it very much, and it doesn't pay very well.
[08:54.96]M: I see. Have you applied for any other jobs?
[08:58.19]W: Yes. I thought I'd like to be a policewoman
[09:01.11]but they turned me down,
[09:02.76]because I was too short.
[09:04.67]M: What would you like to do now then?
[09:06.68]W: Well, I think I'd like to work in a travel agency.
[09:09.94]M: I see. I think the best thing
[09:12.09]is for me to see what we might find for you and then...
[09:16.53]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation
[09:19.29]you have just heard.
[09:21.70]8. How did the woman get to know about the man's company?
[09:42.65]9. What formal education did the woman receive?
[10:02.95]10. What diploma did the woman gain?
[10:22.84]11. What do we learn about the woman's occupation?
[10:42.70]Conversation Two
[10:45.17]W: Steve, can you tell my how long you've been a pub owner?
[10:48.89]M: Well, four years, I suppose.
[10:51.65]I've been involved with pubs off and on for ten years.
[10:55.57]I've sort of done hotel work and I've also run a restaurant pub.
[11:00.17]And now I've got what you'd call a good old-fashioned pub.
[11:03.83]That is, a public bar, with all the social games going with it,
[11:08.50]which is what we've always wanted to have, you know.
[11:11.16]W: It sounds like you've always worked in pubs,
[11:14.07]but not always in this one.
[11:15.99]M: No, no. I've worked in quite a variety of pubs.
[11:19.68]W: What makes a good pub?
[11:21.90]I mean you said, you know, it has got a good variety of things.
[11:26.58]M: Well, I think having the right customers to start with,
[11:30.50]selling the right beer, keeping it good,
[11:33.68]and most of all keeping a good attitude yourself,
[11:36.60]even though you probably feel very tired.
[11:39.67]But the idea is, if you generate it from your side,
[11:43.98]it's got to affect the other side
[11:46.39]if you getting the right customers in.
[11:48.40]W: Yeah. I must say that is one thing
[11:51.46]that's always struck me about being a pub owner.
[11:54.18]I mean a lot of people seem to think that it's a nice job, you know.
[11:58.71]Everybody says "Oh, I'd love to retire and get a country pub."
[12:03.23]But it seems to me that it's actually very hard work.
[12:08.00]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation
[12:11.67]you have just heard.
[12:13.54]12. What does the man say about his involvement with pubs?
[12:34.29]13. What characterizes the old-fashioned pub, according to the man?
[12:55.81]14. What does the man say is most important in making a good pub?
[13:17.06]15. What does the woman think of running a country pub?
[13:37.55]Section C
[13:39.07]Directions: In this section,
[13:41.74]you will hear three passages.
[13:44.25]At the end of each passage,
[13:46.27]you will hear three or four questions.
[13:49.48]Both the passage and the questions
[13:52.10]will be spoken only once.
[13:54.76]After you hear a question,
[13:56.81]you must choose the best answer
[13:59.18]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:04.60]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:08.57]with a single line through the centre.
[14:11.82]Passage One
[14:13.89]To help ourselves and others,
[14:16.00]it's important to know something about drugs.
[14:19.36]A drug is a chemical substance.
[14:22.08]It can bring about a physical, emotional, or mental change in people.
[14:27.83]Alcohol and tobacco are drugs.
[14:30.74]Caffeine, a substance found in coffee and some soft drinks,
[14:35.50]is also a drug.
[14:37.51]Drug abuse is the use of a drug, legal or illegal,
[14:42.24]that hurts a person or someone close to him.
[14:45.50]A drug user is the person who takes the drug.
[14:49.82]There are many kinds of drug users.
[14:52.84]Experimental users may try drugs once or twice.
[14:57.02]They want to see what the effects will be.
[14:59.98]Recreational users take drugs to get high.
[15:03.75]They use drugs with friends or at parties to get into the mood or things.
[15:09.14]Regular users take drugs all the time.
[15:12.39]But they are often able to keep up with the normal routine of work.
[15:17.51]Dependent users can't relate to anything but drugs.
[15:21.67]Their whole life centers around drugs.
[15:24.74]They feel extreme mental or physical pain without drugs.
[15:29.67]It's not always easy to tell if someone is using drugs.
[15:34.10]In the early stages, drug use is often hard to see.
[15:38.88]Sometimes people like drugs or need drugs
[15:42.39]so much they can't do without them.
[15:45.40]They are dependent upon drugs.
[15:47.72]Only a few kinds of drugs can cause physical dependence.
[15:51.95]But almost any drug, when it's misused,
[15:55.21]can make a person think he needs it all the time.
[15:58.87]By this time it's too late, and the person is hooked.
[16:03.80]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:08.96]16. What does the speaker say about drug abuse?
[16:29.60]17. What does the speaker say about recreational drug users?
[16:49.84]18. What does the speaker say about drug dependence?
[17:10.27]Passage Two
[17:12.02]According to Charles Harper, chairman of Conagra,
[17:15.40]the healthy choice line of frozen dinners began with his own heart attack.
[17:20.57]It has been brought on by years of eating anything
[17:23.39]he could get his hands on.
[17:25.66]As he lay in the hospital recovering,
[17:27.97]Harper imagined the line of healthy frozen foods that tasted good.
[17:33.42]The healthy choice product line was carefully tested with consumers
[17:37.61]before being introduced to the general public.
[17:41.32]Conagra's Research and Development staff
[17:43.95]spent a year working under the instruction:
[17:46.96]whatever the cost, don't sacrifice taste.
[17:50.93]The first test market results surprised even the Conagra team.
[17:56.22]The low-sodium, low-fat frozen dinners sold much better than expected.
[18:02.10]According to the firm's vice-president of Marketing and Sales,
[18:06.16]"We benefited from low expectations.
[18:09.08]The products were much better than people thought they would be."
[18:13.24]This finding supported Conagra's decision
[18:15.95]to position the product against other high quality frozen dinners,
[18:20.78]rather than as a diet or health food.
[18:24.40]The new product's brand name and packaging
[18:27.36]were an important part of the development process.
[18:31.12]The name "healthy choice" was chosen
[18:33.58]for the positive implication it held for consumers.
[18:37.51]Because Conagra felt the product would be an impulse purchase,
[18:41.57]it was important to make the item stand out in the freezer case.
[18:46.90]This was accomplished through the dark green packaging
[18:49.86]that not only differed from the competitors,
[18:52.57]but also suggested freshness and richness in vitamins.
[18:57.53]Questions 19 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:03.87]19. What did Charles Harper think of while he was in hospital?
[19:25.07]20. What does the passage say about the health choice product line
[19:30.80]before it went to market?
[19:48.80]21. What is said to contribute to Conagra's business success?
[20:09.94]22. What does the speaker say about the name "healthy choice"?
[20:31.11]Passage Three
[20:33.38]In the United States,
[20:35.04]36 states currently allow capital punishment
[20:38.56]for serious crimes such as murder.
[20:41.82]Americans have always argued about the death penalty.
[20:45.62]Today, there is a serious question about this issue:
[20:49.24]Should there be a minimum age limit for executing criminals?
[20:53.61]In other words, is it right for convicted murders
[20:56.88]who kill when they are minors---that is under the age of 18---
[21:01.46]to receive the death penalty?
[21:03.72]In most other countries of the world,
[21:05.99]there is no capital punishment for minors.
[21:09.47]In the United States, though, each state makes its own decision.
[21:14.64]Of the 36 states that allow the death penalty,
[21:18.70]30 permit the execution of minors.
[21:22.02]In the state of South Carolina,
[21:24.38]a convicted murderer was given the death penalty
[21:27.50]for a crime he committed while he was a minor.
[21:31.42]In 1977, when he was 17 years old,
[21:35.90]James Terry Roach and two friends cruelly murdered three people.
[21:41.52]Roach's lawyer fought the decision to execute him.
[21:45.64]The young murderer remained on Death Row for ten years
[21:49.50]while his lawyer appealed to the governor.
[21:52.42]The lawyer argued that it is wrong to execute a person
[21:56.18]for a crime he committed while he was a minor.
[21:59.96]In the United States,
[22:01.46]the governor of a state has the power
[22:03.74]to change a sentence from the death penalty to life in prison.
[22:08.98]Nonetheless, the governor of South Carolina
[22:12.15]refused to stop the execution.
[22:15.01]Roach was finally executed in 1986.
[22:20.28]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:26.05]23. What does the speaker say
[22:29.06]about the death penalty in the United States?
[22:47.71]24. What is the focus of the debate around the death penalty?
[23:08.93]25. What does the speaker say about James Terry Roach?
[23:29.69]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

	[00:18.63]Part II  Listening Comprehension
	[00:22.04]Section A
	[00:23.19]Directions: In this section,
	[00:26.44]you will hear three news reports.
	[00:29.07]At the end of each news report,
	[00:30.78]you will hear two or three questions.
	[00:32.59]Both the news report and the questions
	[00:35.63]will be spoken only once.
	[00:37.60]After you hear a question,
	[00:39.92]you must choose the best answer
	[00:41.84]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
	[00:45.31]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
	[00:49.40]with a single line through the centre.
	[00:52.53]News Report One
	[00:54.74]A nine-year-old girl in New Mexico
	[00:57.20]has raised more than 500 dollars for her little brother
	[01:00.87]who needs heart surgery in Houston, Texas, this July.
	[01:05.00]Addison Witulski's grandmother, Kim Allred, said
	[01:09.33]Addison probably overheard a conversation between family members
	[01:13.86]talking about the funds needed
	[01:16.40]to get her little brother to treatment.
	[01:19.48]"I guess she overheard her grandfather and me talking
	[01:22.39]about how we're worried about
	[01:24.38]how we're going to get to Houston,
	[01:26.34]for my grandson's heart surgery," said Allred.
	[01:29.52]She decided to go outside and have a lemonade stand
	[01:33.76]and make some drawings and pictures and sell them.
	[01:36.84]That's when Addison and her friends Erika
	[01:40.33]and Emily Borden decided to sell lemonade for 50 cents a cup
	[01:44.88]and sell pictures for 25 cents each.
	[01:48.45]Before Allred knew it, New Mexico State Police Officers
	[01:53.10]were among the many stopping by, helping them reach a total of 568 dollars.
	[01:59.55]The family turned to social media expressing their gratitude  saying,
	[02:04.45]"From the bottom of our hearts,
	[02:06.91]we would like to deeply thank each and every person that stopped by!"
	[02:13.30]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
	[02:19.30]1. Who did Addison raise money for?
	[02:35.47]2. How did Addison raise money?
	[02:51.45]News Report Two
	[02:53.42]Last week, France announced that the country would pave 621 miles
	[03:00.07]of road with solar panels over the next five years,
	[03:04.83]with the goal of providing cheap, renewable energy to five million people.
	[03:10.62]Called "the Wattway," the roads will be built through joint efforts
	[03:14.59]with the French road-building company Colas
	[03:17.43]and the National Institute of Solar Energy.
	[03:20.58]The company spent the last five years developing solar panels
	[03:24.72]that are only about a quarter of an inch thick
	[03:27.89]and are strong enough to stand up to heavy highway traffic
	[03:31.15]without breaking or making the roads more slippery.
	[03:35.21]The panels are also designed so that they can be installed directly
	[03:39.48]on top of existing roadways,
	[03:41.96]making them relatively cheap and easy to install.
	[03:45.99]France isn't the first country to kick around the idea
	[03:49.41]of paving its roads with solar panels.
	[03:52.70]In November 2015, the Netherlands completed a 229-foot-long bike path
	[03:59.20]paved with solar panels as a test for future projects.
	[04:03.85]However, this is the first time a panel has been designed
	[04:07.93]to be laid directly on top of existing roads
	[04:11.61]and the first project to install the panels on public highways.
	[04:17.13]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
	[04:22.13]3. What was France's purpose of constructing "the Wattway"?
	[04:39.88]4. What is special about the solar panels used in "the Wattway"?
	[04:58.71]News Report Three
	[05:01.23]Lions have disappeared from much of Africa,
	[05:04.31]but for the past few years scientists have wondered
	[05:08.18]if the big cats were hanging on in remote parts of Sudan and Ethiopia.
	[05:13.83]Continuous fighting in the region has made surveys difficult.
	[05:18.69]But scientists released a report Monday
	[05:22.61]documenting, with hard evidence, the discovery of "lost lions."
	[05:28.09]A team with Oxford University's Wildlife Conservation Research Unit,
	[05:33.40]supported by a charity organization, spent two nights in November
	[05:38.56]camping in the National Park in northwest Ethiopia,
	[05:42.55]on the Ethiopia-Sudan border.
	[05:45.90]The researchers set out six camera traps,
	[05:49.13]capturing images of lions, and they identified lion tracks.
	[05:54.07]The scientists concluded that lions
	[05:57.69]are also likely to live in the neighboring National Park
	[06:01.74] across the border in Sudan.
	[06:04.01]The International Union for Conservation of Nature
	[06:07.72]had previously considered the area a "possible range"
	[06:11.54]for the species,
	[06:13.06]and local people had reported seeing lions in the area,
	[06:16.45]but no one presented convincing evidence.
	[06:20.74]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
	[06:27.69]5. What has made it difficult to survey lions
	[06:32.80]in remote part of Sudan and Ethiopia?
	[06:49.29]6. What was the main purpose of the research?
	[07:06.65]7. What did the researchers find in the National Park?
	[07:25.65]Section B
	[07:27.21]Directions: In this section,
	[07:29.94]you will hear two long conversations.
	[07:32.61]At the end of each conversation,
	[07:35.08]you will hear four questions.
	[07:36.87]Both the conversation and the questions
	[07:40.04]will be spoken only once.
	[07:42.81]After you hear a question,
	[07:44.44]you must choose the best answer
	[07:46.36]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
	[07:51.25]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
	[07:56.04]with a single line through the centre.
	[07:59.47]Conversation One
	[08:01.85]M: I bet you're looking forward to the end of this month, aren't you?
	[08:05.67]W: Yes, I am. How did you know?
	[08:08.95]M: David told me you had a special birthday coming up.
	[08:12.08]W: Oh, yes. That's right. This year will be my golden birthday.
	[08:17.55]M: What does that mean? I've never heard of a golden birthday.
	[08:22.00]W: I've actually just learnt of this concept myself.
	[08:25.50]Fortunately, just in time to celebrate.
	[08:29.46]A golden or lucky birthday is when one turns the age of their birth date.
	[08:35.55]So, for example, my sister's birthday is December 9th
	[08:39.90]and her golden birthday would have been the year
	[08:43.13]she turned nine years old.
	[08:45.53]Come to think of it, my parents did
	[08:48.07]throw her a surprise party that year.
	[08:50.67]M: Interesting. Too bad I missed mine.
	[08:54.62]My golden birthday would have been four years ago.
	[08:58.36]I assume you got big plans then.
	[09:00.77]W: Actually yes. My husband is planning a surprise holiday
	[09:04.52]for the two of us next week.
	[09:06.62]I've no idea what he's got in mind,
	[09:09.08]but I'm excited to find out. Has he mentioned anything to you?
	[09:14.34]M: He might have.
	[09:16.29]W: Anything you'd like to share?
	[09:17.69]I'm dying to know what kind of trip he has planned or where we're going.
	[09:21.71]M: You know nothing at all?
	[09:23.87]W: Not a clue. Hard to imagine, isn't it?
	[09:26.98]Though I must say I think he's been having even more fun
	[09:31.28]keeping the secret from me the past few weeks.
	[09:35.24]M: I'm sure both of you will have a fantastic time.
	[09:38.69]Happy golden birthday! I can't wait to hear all about it when you get back.
	[09:45.01]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
	[09:50.48]8. What is the woman looking forward to?
	[10:06.89]9. What did the woman's parents do on her sister's lucky birthday?
	[10:25.84]10. What is the woman eager to find out about?
	[10:43.18]11. What does the man say at the end of the conversation?
	[11:01.29]Conversation Two
	[11:03.39]W: Mr. Green, what do you think makes a successful negotiator?
	[11:08.81]M: Well, that's hard to define.
	[11:11.66]But I think successful negotiators have several things in common.
	[11:17.23]They are always polite and rational people.
	[11:20.63]They are firm but flexible.
	[11:23.09]They can recognize power and know how to use it.
	[11:26.49]They are sensitive to the dynamics of a negotiation,
	[11:30.74]the way it rises and falls and how it may change direction.
	[11:35.30]They project an image of confidence,
	[11:38.62]and perhaps most importantly, they know when to stop.
	[11:44.39]W: And, what about an unsuccessful negotiator?
	[11:48.41]M: Well, this is probably all of us when we start out.
	[11:53.59]We are probably immature and over-trusting,
	[11:57.69]too emotional or aggressive.
	[12:00.45]We are unsure of ourselves and we want to be liked by everyone.
	[12:05.36]Good negotiators learn fast.
	[12:08.47]Poor negotiators remain like that and go on losing negotiations.
	[12:13.19]W: In your opinion, can the skills of negotiation be taught?
	[12:18.24]M: Well, you can teach someone how to prepare for a negotiation.
	[12:22.61]There are perhaps six stages in every negotiation.
	[12:26.73]Get to know the other side. State your goals. Start the process.
	[12:34.04]Clarify areas of disagreement or conflict.
	[12:37.79]Reassess your position, making acceptable compromises.
	[12:43.25]And finally, reach some agreement in principle.
	[12:46.85]These stages can be studied.
	[12:49.66]And strategies to be used in each can be planned beforehand.
	[12:54.26]But I think, the really successful negotiator is probably born
	[12:58.45]with six sense about responding appropriately to the situation at hand.
	[13:03.62]W: The artistic sense you've just described?
	[13:06.80]M: Yes. That's right.
	[13:09.74]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
	[13:14.66]12. What does the man say about good negotiators?
	[13:32.81]13. What does the man say may be the most important thing
	[13:38.57]to a successful negotiator?
	[13:53.25]14. How is a good negotiator different from a poor one?
	[14:12.06]15. What is the first stage of negotiation according to the man?
	[14:29.70]Section C
	[14:31.11]Directions: In this section,
	[14:33.76]you will hear three passages.
	[14:35.71]At the end of each passage,
	[14:37.97]you will hear three or four questions.
	[14:40.58]Both the passage and the questions
	[14:43.23]will be spoken only once.
	[14:45.47]After you hear a question,
	[14:47.50]you must choose the best answer
	[14:49.65]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
	[14:54.75]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
	[14:58.85]with a single line through the centre.
	[15:01.35]Passage One
	[15:02.81]Some people wonder why countries
	[15:05.05]spend millions of dollars on space projects.
	[15:09.02]They want to know how space research helps people on Earth.
	[15:13.62]Actually space technology helps people on Earth every day.
	[15:19.30]This is called "spin-off technology."
	[15:22.65]Spin-off technology is space technology that is now used on Earth.
	[15:28.00]In early space programs,
	[15:31.03]such as the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s,
	[15:35.39]and in the Space Shuttle missions today,
	[15:38.49]scientists developed objects for the astronauts
	[15:41.85]to use on the moon and in space.
	[15:45.26]We now use some of these objects every day.
	[15:48.86]For example, we have quartz crystal clocks
	[15:52.01]and watches accurate to within one minute a year.
	[15:56.58]We purify the water we drink with a water filter
	[16:00.64]designed for the astronauts' use in space.
	[16:04.09]The cordless, hand-held tools we use in our homes,
	[16:09.21]such as vacuum cleaners, flashlights, drills and saws
	[16:14.97]came from the technology of these early space programs.
	[16:18.07]On cold winter days we can stay warm
	[16:22.07]with battery-operated gloves and socks,
	[16:25.27]and specially made coats and jackets.
	[16:28.89]All these clothes are similar to the spacesuit designs
	[16:31.89]that kept astronauts comfortable in the temperatures of the moon,
	[16:36.26]and are spin-offs from space technology.
	[16:39.97]These products are only a few examples
	[16:42.76]of the many ways space technology helps us in our everyday lives.
	[16:47.94]No one knows how new spin-off technology
	[16:52.33]from the International Space Station will help us in the future.
	[16:56.44]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
	[17:01.89]16. What do some people want to know about space exploration?
	[17:20.33]17. What did scientists do for the space shuttle missions?
	[17:38.66]18. What does the speaker say about quartz crystal clocks and watches?
	[17:57.71]Passage Two
	[17:59.36]Well, if I could go back in history and live,
	[18:03.42]I'd like to go back to the 18th century
	[18:06.68]and perhaps in colonial America in Yankee, New England,
	[18:11.29]where one of my ancestors lived,
	[18:14.33]because it was the beginning of something.
	[18:16.88]By the 18th century,
	[18:18.67]there was a feeling of community that had grown.
	[18:21.68]My ancestor was a preacher, traveling around the countryside.
	[18:26.28]People lived in small communities.
	[18:28.58]There were fishermen and farmers who provided fresh food
	[18:32.65]that tasted and looked like food,
	[18:34.74]unlike that in today's supermarkets,
	[18:37.79]and there were small towns,
	[18:39.70]and New York wasn't that far away.
	[18:42.59]I'm deeply attached to the Puritan tradition,
	[18:45.60]not in a religious sense,
	[18:48.05]but they believed in working for something,
	[18:51.00]working for goals, and I like that.
	[18:53.25]They worked hard at whatever they did,
	[18:56.53]but they had a sense of achievement.
	[18:58.88]They believed in goodness in community and helping one another.
	[19:04.13]I love the colonial fabrics, all the silver work,
	[19:08.39]the furnishings, the combination of elegance and simplicity.
	[19:13.09]I love it. The printing, the books,
	[19:16.19]I'm very attached to all that kind of thing
	[19:19.49]that may not all be very entertaining in the modern sense of the world.
	[19:23.70]But I would have enjoyed spending my evenings in that environment,
	[19:28.36]discussing new ideas, building a new world.
	[19:32.17]And I can see myself sitting on a small chair by the fire doing needlework.
	[19:38.58]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
	[19:43.51]19. Why does the speaker say she would like to go back
	[19:50.26]and live in the 18th century America?
	[20:07.51]20. What does the speaker say about the Puritans?
	[20:25.62]21. What would the speaker like doing if she could go back to the past?
	[20:45.07]Passage Three
	[20:47.22]If you are lost in the woods,
	[20:49.58]a little knowledge can turn what some people call a hardship
	[20:53.73]into an enjoyable stay away from the troubles of modern society.
	[20:58.34]When you think you are lost,
	[21:01.44]sit down on a log or rock, or lean against a tree,
	[21:06.53]and recite something that you have memorized,
	[21:08.88]to bring your mind to a point where it's under control.
	[21:12.74]Don't run blindly. If you must move,
	[21:17.22]don't follow a stream unless you know it,
	[21:20.77]and in that case, you are not lost.
	[21:24.06]Streams, normally flow through wetland
	[21:26.92]before they reach a lake or a river.
	[21:29.99]Though there are more eatable plants,
	[21:32.92]there may also be wild animals, poisonous snakes, and other hazards.
	[21:39.68]Many experts feel that it's wisest to walk uphill.
	[21:44.49]At the top of most hills and mountains,
	[21:47.59]are trails leading back to civilization.
	[21:50.85]If there are no trails,
	[21:52.81]you are much easier to be seen on top of a hill,
	[21:56.36]and you may even spot a highway,
	[21:58.77]or a railroad from this point.
	[22:01.87]Nowadays, the first way someone will search for you is by air.
	[22:06.89]In a wetland, or in dense growth,
	[22:09.90]you are very hard to spot.
	[22:11.96]Anytime you go into the woods,
	[22:14.91]somebody should know where you are going,
	[22:17.68]and when you expect to return.
	[22:19.99]Also, when someone comes looking,
	[22:23.38]you should be able to signal to them.
	[22:26.13]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
	[22:32.09]22. What does the speaker advise you to do first
	[22:36.70]if you are lost in the woods?
	[22:50.85]23. What will happen if you follow an unknown stream in the woods?
	[23:09.96]24. What do many experts think is the wisest thing to do
	[23:16.12]if you are lost in the woods?
	[23:30.67]25. What should you do before you go into the woods?
	[23:48.48]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

	[00:18.07]Part II  Listening Comprehension
	[00:21.56]Section A
	[00:23.25]Directions: In this section,
	[00:26.19]you will hear three news reports.
	[00:28.39]At the end of each news report,
	[00:30.50]you will hear two or three questions.
	[00:32.90]Both the news report and the questions
	[00:35.54]will be spoken only once.
	[00:37.79]After you hear a question,
	[00:39.03]you must choose the best answer
	[00:41.72]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
	[00:45.75]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
	[00:49.63]with a single line through the centre.
	[00:52.43]News Report One
	[00:54.67]A New Jersey black bear that walks upright on its two back legs 
	[00:58.95]and has become a social media darling has re-emerged 
	[01:02.93]and has been captured on video months after its last sighting.
	[01:07.76]The bear named Pedals was spotted in the town of Oak Ridge. 
	[01:12.98]In a video posted to Facebook featuring the bear, 
	[01:16.49]it appeared to be in relatively good health and was moving quickly. 
	[01:21.51]Pedals apparently has an injured leg or paw 
	[01:25.38]that doesn't allow it to walk comfortably on all fours, 
	[01:29.27]according to experts. 
	[01:30.91]Lawrence Hajna, 
	[01:32.75]spokesman for the state Department of Environmental Protection, 
	[01:36.53]said officials expect the bear to make it through next winter.
	[01:41.37]The bear first gained fame 
	[01:44.16]after it was spotted wandering around neighborhoods 
	[01:47.09]and was caught on videos 
	[01:48.98]that were posted on social media 
	[01:51.43]and shown on national television.
	[01:54.24]Last year, 
	[01:55.73]supporters pushed for Pedals to be moved to a shelter, 
	[01:59.25]but New Jersey officials have said 
	[02:02.08]they won't allow the bear 
	[02:03.49]to be captured and transferred to the facility. 
	[02:06.67]"The bear would do better in its natural habitat 
	[02:09.95]and the agency would step in 
	[02:11.90]if its condition deteriorated," they said.
	[02:15.10]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
	[02:21.52]1. What is the probable reason the bear walks upright on its back legs?
	[02:41.75]2. How is the bear first known to the public?
	[02:59.00]News Report Two
	[03:00.94]It's not your imagination: 
	[03:02.68]Traffic in the U.S. is actually getting worse. 
	[03:06.31]Americans drove more miles last year 
	[03:09.32]than any other year on record. 
	[03:11.31]The U.S. Department of Transportation says 
	[03:14.40]Americans drove nearly 3,150 billion miles last year. 
	[03:19.58]That's about the same distance 
	[03:21.22]as 337 round trips from Earth to Pluto. 
	[03:24.82]The previous record was 3,003 billion miles in 2007, 
	[03:30.35]before the economic recession and high gas prices. 
	[03:33.88]The traffic increase comes at the same time 
	[03:36.77]as gas prices drop significantly. 
	[03:39.62]The current average gas price in the U.S. is $1.71 per gallon. 
	[03:45.41]A year ago it was $2.31 per gallon 
	[03:49.32]and was often much higher in recent years. 
	[03:52.36]A transportation expert told the reporter that 
	[03:55.30]job growth likely plays a part as well, 
	[03:57.69]along with some people driving longer distances to and from work. 
	[04:01.62]And so all this means more traffic jams on the road. 
	[04:05.85]The Texas A&M Travel Institute found that 
	[04:09.23]rush-hour travelers spent an extra 42 hours on the road last year 
	[04:13.32]because of travel delays. 
	[04:15.32]Now, that is depressing. 
	[04:18.15]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
	[04:22.18]3. What new record did the American drivers set last year?
	[04:40.35]4. What is depressing according to the speaker?
	[04:58.60]News Report Three
	[05:00.80]A sixteen-year-old asked a stranger at a grocery store 
	[05:04.29]to buy him and his mother some food 
	[05:06.83]in exchange for carrying the man's groceries to his car. 
	[05:10.86]What happened next will pull at your heartstrings.
	[05:14.06]A wonderful bond formed between the two, 
	[05:17.79]and within a couple of weeks, 
	[05:19.14]the stranger named White, 
	[05:21.62]helped raise $190,000 on a website 
	[05:25.41]to support the Memphis teenager and his disabled mother. 
	[05:29.39]"When Chauncy approached me, 
	[05:31.43]it just pulled at my heart," White said. 
	[05:33.93]"Here comes Chauncy, 
	[05:35.82]just trying to get food for him and his Mom off the grace of other people. 
	[05:40.79]When I looked at him 
	[05:42.24]and saw what he was doing 
	[05:43.73]and what he was asking for, 
	[05:45.72]I said he was my hero."
	[05:48.71]"Chauncy is a top student 
	[05:50.68]who is doing his best to make it 
	[05:52.72]in a world with no money and very few resources," 
	[05:56.46]White explained on the crowdfunding site. 
	[05:59.60]"He wants to work and help his mother financially.
	[06:02.88]It's so rare that 
	[06:04.79]we get an opportunity to affect so much change on one life." 
	[06:09.07]White wrote, 
	[06:10.51]"I cannot thank you enough for caring about Chauncy. 
	[06:13.69]This is his big chance, and you're making it possible."
	[06:18.53]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
	[06:23.76]5. What did the teenager Chauncy do at the grocery store to get some food?
	[06:43.08]6. What did the stranger do for Chauncy?
	[07:00.33]7. What do we learn about Chauncy?
	[07:17.18]Section B
	[07:18.57]Directions: In this section,
	[07:21.02]you will hear two long conversations.
	[07:23.67]At the end of each conversation,
	[07:25.96]you will hear four questions.
	[07:28.54]Both the conversation and the questions
	[07:31.18]will be spoken only once.
	[07:33.82]After you hear a question,
	[07:35.76]you must choose the best answer
	[07:37.90]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
	[07:42.93]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
	[07:47.70]with a single line through the centre.
	[07:51.28]Conversation One
	[07:53.63]M: That was my last economics lecture of the week, 
	[07:56.99]and here's the weekend again.
	[07:59.13]W: What are you up to tonight? 
	[08:00.72]I was just wondering 
	[08:01.82]if we could try out the new restaurant on Charles Street, 
	[08:05.26]then go on to Queen Victoria for a drink.
	[08:08.14]M: Sorry, I'm heading home this weekend 
	[08:11.13]for my brother's 18th birthday.
	[08:13.57]W: Oh, that's great.
	[08:15.07]M: All my relatives are gonna be there, 
	[08:17.81]as well as my brother's horrible friends, of course. 
	[08:21.19]Listen, why don't you come along? 
	[08:23.99]Mom would be absolutely delighted to see you again. 
	[08:27.37]She's always asking after you.
	[08:29.46]W: Yes, I'd love to see her too. 
	[08:31.55]M: So, please, do come. It'll be great. 
	[08:34.69]And besides, with Jonathan's wild game to contend with, 
	[08:38.32]I'd really welcome an ally. 
	[08:40.91]W: That sounds tempting, 
	[08:42.20]but I won't be ready till 5:00, 
	[08:44.19]as I've got my statistics seminar now. 
	[08:46.43]What time are you heading off?
	[08:48.34]M: Well, I was going to leave right away. 
	[08:51.08]However, I can hang around for you if you like. 
	[08:54.33]It just means that I'll need to change my ticket.
	[08:57.21]W: But would that be too much trouble for you? 
	[08:59.61]M: No, not at all. 
	[09:01.26]I'll go to the station first, 
	[09:03.21]and see if I can get tickets for us on the 6:30 train. 
	[09:07.47]Then, you can join me there. 
	[09:09.56]I'll text you when it's done.
	[09:11.65]W: Brilliant. Are you absolutely positive it's okay? 
	[09:15.63]I wouldn't want to impose.
	[09:17.37]M: Don't worry. You're most welcome to join our party. 
	[09:21.00]And, as I always say, the more the merrier.
	[09:24.68]W: Look, I'd better go or I'll be late. 
	[09:27.37]So, I'll meet you down at the station around 6:00?
	[09:31.10]M: Fine. See you later.
	[09:33.84]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
	[09:38.52]8. What has the man just done?
	[09:56.67]9. What is the man going to do this weekend?
	[10:13.61]10. What does the man ask the woman to do?
	[10:30.82]11. How will they go to the man's home?
	[10:47.90]Conversation Two
	[10:49.75]M: Hi, Jane. How's everything going?
	[10:54.42]W: So far so good. 
	[10:56.12]I've just finished my last exam.
	[10:58.55]M: Good. The term is coming to an end. 
	[11:01.44]Do you think we should take a holiday overseas to relax and have fun? 
	[11:05.69]I've saved my tips from my waiter job these past few months, 
	[11:09.21]and I should have enough by July.
	[11:11.31]W: Yes, that's a wonderful idea. 
	[11:13.50]I've got a little put-aside for a rainy day, 
	[11:16.64]but I might need to earn a little more before we go. 
	[11:20.37]By the way, what's it like working in a restaurant?
	[11:24.05]M: Well, it's really tough, 
	[11:26.84]as working a 10-hour shift is like hell. 
	[11:29.93]I'm not sure it'll suit you, 
	[11:32.22]but it's pretty cool if your boss is all right. 
	[11:34.66]Do you think we should invite some others to come along?
	[11:38.05]W: Yes, we could ask Tom and Tracy if they're interested. 
	[11:42.53]I haven't been abroad for a long while, 
	[11:45.37]and it would be great to go somewhere by the sea. 
	[11:48.16]I can't wait. 
	[11:50.26]And, if Tom goes, we could go sailing. 
	[11:53.84]He has a lot of experience with boats, 
	[11:56.94]and it'll work out a lot cheaper to hire one 
	[11:59.47]if there's more of us to share the cost.
	[12:02.06]M: So, that's a plan. 
	[12:04.80]We'll save as much as we can and go sailing next July. 
	[12:09.18]Let's say Spain, but anywhere cheap will be fine.
	[12:13.81]W: Okay, but first we'd better contact Tom and Tracy 
	[12:17.74]and see if they are up for it. 
	[12:19.74]If not, it'll be back to the drawing board.
	[12:23.57]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
	[12:28.76]12. What does the man think of doing?
	[12:46.57]13. What has the man been doing for the past few months?
	[13:06.25]14. What does the woman say she needs to do before departure?
	[13:24.99]15. Why does the woman want to invite Tom?
	[13:42.49]Section C
	[13:43.86]Directions: In this section,
	[13:46.45]you will hear three passages.
	[13:48.54]At the end of each passage,
	[13:50.53]you will hear three or four questions.
	[13:53.47]Both the passage and the questions
	[13:55.81]will be spoken only once.
	[13:58.14]After you hear a question,
	[13:59.89]you must choose the best answer
	[14:01.68]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
	[14:07.02]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
	[14:11.16]with a single line through the centre.
	[14:13.98]Passage One
	[14:15.68]Most people know Marie Curie was the first woman 
	[14:19.42]to win the Nobel Prize, 
	[14:21.06]and the first person to win it twice. 
	[14:24.10]However, few people know that 
	[14:27.23]she was also the mother of a Nobel Prize winner. 
	[14:30.67]Irene Curie was born on September 12, 1897. 
	[14:35.79]At the age of 10, 
	[14:37.88]Irene's talents and interest in mathematics were apparent. 
	[14:42.21]Irene entered Sorbonne University in October 1914, 
	[14:47.74]to prepare for a degree in mathematics and physics. 
	[14:51.27]When World War I began, 
	[14:53.66]she left Sorbonne University to help her mother, 
	[14:57.08]who was using X-ray facilities 
	[14:59.02]to help save the lives of wounded soldiers. 
	[15:02.26]Irene continued this work by developing X-ray facilities 
	[15:07.38]for military hospitals in France and Belgium. 
	[15:11.36]After the war, she received a Military Medal for her work. 
	[15:16.49]In 1918, Irene became her mother's assistant at the Curie Institute. 
	[15:23.11]In December 1924, Frederic Joliot visited the Institute, 
	[15:28.88]where he met Marie Curie. 
	[15:30.63]Frederic became one of her assistants 
	[15:33.36]and Irene taught him the techniques required to work with radioactivity. 
	[15:38.14]Irene and Frederic soon fell in love 
	[15:41.37]and got married on October 29, 1926. 
	[15:45.95]Their daughter was born in 1927 and their son in 1932. 
	[15:51.82]Like her mother, Irene combined family with career. 
	[15:56.41]Like her mother, Irene was awarded a Nobel Prize, 
	[16:01.15]along with her husband Frederic, in 1935, 
	[16:05.18]for producing new radioactive elements. 
	[16:08.31]Unfortunately, also like her mother, 
	[16:11.65]she developed blood cancer because of her exposure to radiation. 
	[16:16.08]Irene Joliot-Curie died on March 17, 1956.
	[16:22.94]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
	[16:28.62]16. What does the speaker say about Marie Curie's daughter?
	[16:46.96]17. For what was Irene Curie awarded a Military Medal?
	[17:05.69]18. In what way were Marie and Irene similar?
	[17:23.67]Passage Two
	[17:25.71]Have you ever heard of the Vikings? 
	[17:28.50]They were sea travelers from Norway. 
	[17:31.09]More than a thousand years ago, 
	[17:33.18]they made three important geographical discoveries. 
	[17:37.16]The Vikings' first major discovery occurred in the ninth century. 
	[17:42.18]A man called Naddod was on his way 
	[17:45.39]from Norway to the Faroe Islands, north of England, 
	[17:49.19]when his ship was caught in a storm. 
	[17:51.93]The storm blew the ship west for several days. 
	[17:55.91]When the weather cleared, 
	[17:57.54]Naddod found himself on the coast of a new land. 
	[18:01.77]Later, Viking travelers named it Iceland. 
	[18:06.25]In 982, 
	[18:08.53]a Viking called Eric the Red sailed west in search of new land. 
	[18:14.11]500 miles west of Iceland, 
	[18:17.20]he and his men reached an icy rocky mass of land. 
	[18:21.93]They sailed around it until they reached the western side. 
	[18:26.96]Here, they found some green areas, 
	[18:30.29]so they named the island Greenland. 
	[18:33.28]Then, in 1001, the Vikings made their most important discovery. 
	[18:40.24]The son of Eric the Red, named Leif Ericson, 
	[18:44.18]had heard rumors about land west of Greenland. 
	[18:48.90]He sailed west and soon found it. 
	[18:51.74]He and his men landed in three places. 
	[18:55.38]They called the first one Helluland, 
	[18:58.53]which means land of flat stones. 
	[19:01.37]The Vikings then sailed south and made their second landing. 
	[19:06.09]They named this place Markland. 
	[19:09.28]Their third landing was at a place they called Vinland. 
	[19:13.51]Leif Ericson and his men were the first Europeans 
	[19:17.34]to walk on the shores of North America, 
	[19:20.87]almost 500 years earlier than Columbus.
	[19:26.49]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
	[19:31.93]19. What do we learn about the Vikings?
	[19:51.48]20. What does the passage say about Greenland?
	[20:09.39]21. What does the speaker mainly talk about?
	[20:28.97]Passage Three
	[20:30.91]Where do you think you'll be in ten years? 
	[20:34.70]It's difficult to know exactly where you will be, 
	[20:39.13]and what you will be doing, 
	[20:40.72]but everyone dreams about the future. 
	[20:43.16]You might imagine the job you will get when you finish school. 
	[20:48.43]You may daydream about meeting your life partner, 
	[20:52.62]or living in a big house by the sea. 
	[20:55.75]In my dreams, I would have twins, a boy and a girl. 
	[21:02.62]We would live in a large two-story house 
	[21:06.57]with floors and a staircase made of wood. 
	[21:10.13]Now, at the age of 46, I look back on those dreams and smile. 
	[21:15.38]Things haven't turned out exactly as I imagined, 
	[21:18.51]but I wouldn't change what I have now for that imaginary world. 
	[21:22.74]In college, I studied international business, 
	[21:26.43]and planned to enter a law school. 
	[21:28.76]In my third year of university,
	[21:31.10]I realized that I didn't want to become a lawyer. 
	[21:33.74]Instead, I chose to become a language teacher. 
	[21:37.37]I did get married, but had more than two children. 
	[21:42.28]We had five. 
	[21:43.52]Do I live in the dream house with wooden floors? 
	[21:46.81]No, I don't, 
	[21:48.70]but I love my home and I wouldn't want to live in any other place. 
	[21:53.28]I believe that as a young person, 
	[21:55.67]it is important to dream and make plans. 
	[21:58.80]However, it's also important to realize that 
	[22:02.68]not all of your plans will turn out exactly as you wish. 
	[22:06.42]One of the biggest lessons I've learned in life is this: 
	[22:10.05]be happy with what you have. 
	[22:14.29]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
	[22:19.63]22. What does the speaker think everyone tends to do?
	[22:39.05]23. What does the speaker say he would refuse to do?
	[22:57.59]24. What did the speaker major in during the first two years of college?
	[23:16.73]25. What is one of the biggest lessons the speaker has learned in life?
	[23:36.50]This is the end of listening comprehension.

[00:14.52]College English Test - Band 4
[00:19.23]Part II  Listening Comprehension
[00:22.77]Section A
[00:24.38]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.54]you will hear three news reports.
[00:30.33]At the end of each news report,
[00:32.69]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:35.44]Both the news report and the questions
[00:38.00]will be spoken only once.
[00:41.35]After you hear a question,
[00:43.11]you must choose the best answer
[00:45.21]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:50.14]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:54.00]with a single line through the centre.
[00:57.93]News Report One
[01:00.76]Gene-editing has been attempted on cells inside a patient, 
[01:05.52]in a world first by doctors in California.
[01:08.15]Brian Madeux, 44 from Arizona, 
[01:11.60]was given the experimental treatment to try to correct a defect 
[01:15.67]in his DNA that causes Hunter's syndrome. 
[01:18.95]Mr. Madeux says he was prepared to take part in the trial 
[01:23.17]as he is "in pain every second of the day".
[01:26.82]It is too soon to know 
[01:28.74]whether or not the gene-editing has worked in Mr. Madeux's case.
[01:33.44]Hunter's syndrome is rare. 
[01:35.54]Patients are born without the genetic instructions for an enzyme---
[01:39.97]a chemical substance that breaks down long sugary molecules. 
[01:44.70]Instead, long sugary molecules build up in the body 
[01:48.81]and damage the brain and other organs. 
[01:51.67]Severe cases are often fatal.
[01:54.56]Patients need regular enzyme replacement therapy 
[01:58.15]to break down long sugary molecules. 
[02:00.98]But Mr. Madeux has been given an experimental treatment 
[02:04.61]to rewrite his DNA to give him the instructions for making the enzyme.  
[02:10.77]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard. 
[02:17.06]1. What's the news report mainly about? 
[02:36.26]2. What do we learn about Mr. Madeux?
[02:53.15]News Report Two
[02:54.48]Seventy years ago, a young British couple was shot dead 
[02:58.60]at a mission hospital in Kashmir, 
[03:01.31]making orphans of their three sons---one only two weeks old. 
[03:06.08]To mark the anniversary two of those sons, now white-haired, 
[03:10.77]made a personal pilgrimage to the spot.
[03:13.75]"I feel very emotional to be here," says Doug Dykes, 
[03:17.71]standing yards from the spot 
[03:19.86]where his mother and father suffered fatal bullet wounds 
[03:22.78]when he was two years old.
[03:25.04]"I saw my parents being killed---that's what I've been told. 
[03:30.11]My father tried to stop the attackers approaching the nuns 
[03:33.46]and he was shot. I ran screaming towards my father. 
[03:37.46]My mother ran after me ---and then she was also shot."
[03:42.06]There's a touch of anguish in his recollections---
[03:45.56]a sense that he may in some way have been responsible for 
[03:49.82]the death of his mother. 
[03:51.47]We are standing by his parents' graves 
[03:54.44]in this remote corner of the Kashmir valley, 
[03:57.39]the headstones shaded by recently harvested apple and walnut trees. 
[04:02.40]It may seem like a peaceful spot, 
[04:05.08]but 70 years later the conflict continues to claim lives 
[04:09.84]just about every day. 
[04:11.49]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard. 
[04:18.84]3. What happened to Doug Dykes' parents? 
[04:36.76]4. What do we know about Kashmir? 
[04:53.46]News Report Three
[04:55.50]The search for an Argentine naval submarine 
[04:58.49]that went missing with 44 crew on board is being hampered by 
[05:02.45]bad weather conditions, officials say.
[05:05.16]Teams from several countries have intensified their efforts 
[05:09.17]in the South Atlantic to find the ARA San Juan submarine, 
[05:13.80]which vanished on Wednesday.
[05:15.62]On Saturday, several satellite signals 
[05:18.89]thought to have come from the sub were detected 
[05:21.52]near the Valdez peninsula. 
[05:23.68]A NASA research plane was used 
[05:26.06]in an attempt to trace the location but was unsuccessful.
[05:29.96]Rescue teams have also been hindered by 
[05:32.92]heavy winds and high waves.
[05:35.20]"The weather in the area of operations 
[05:38.33]continues to be very difficult," 
[05:40.76]Navy Admiral Gabriel Gonzalez said on Sunday. 
[05:44.42]"Right now, we have waves of six to eight metres high 
[05:49.21]with west to southwest winds of 40 knots, 
[05:52.82]and unfortunately it appears that these conditions 
[05:56.12]will remain for the next 48 hours," he said.
[05:59.84]Mr. Gonzalez added that the search for the vessel 
[06:03.34]was further complicated by the fact that 
[06:05.96]it has "very little visual area" from the surface, 
[06:09.94]making it difficult to detect. 
[06:14.39]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard. 
[06:19.06]5. When did the Argentine naval submarine disappear? 
[06:38.52]6. How was the attempt of the NASA research plane to 
[06:43.29]locate the missing submarine? 
[06:58.38]7. What worsened the situation for the search of the submarine? 
[07:17.73]Section B
[07:19.18]Directions: In this section,
[07:21.53]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:24.88]At the end of each conversation,
[07:27.43]you will hear four questions.
[07:30.29]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:33.42]will be spoken only once.
[07:35.97]After you hear a question,
[07:38.24]you must choose the best answer
[07:40.64]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:46.43]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:51.13]with a single line through the centre.
[07:55.60]Conversation One
[07:57.53]M: Well, did you enjoy it?
[07:59.52]W: Yes, I enjoy it much more than I thought I would.
[08:03.79]M: Really?
[08:04.84]W: Yes, I don't usually go to science fiction films.
[08:08.47]I don't think they are much better than comics on film,
[08:12.19]if you know what I mean.
[08:13.54]M: Yes, sure.
[08:15.41]And a few years ago, they were certainly like that.
[08:18.75]But they've got a lot better now.
[08:21.05]W: Yes, and historical films, that's what I really like.
[08:25.94]I never miss a good film set in the Middle Ages.
[08:29.59]Oh, and love stories, I never miss one on TV.
[08:34.49]M: Funnily enough,
[08:36.04]I don't like those kinds of films at all.
[08:38.96]But to come back to this one,
[08:41.17]I personally didn't think it was very good.
[08:44.18]It certainly wasn't as good as other science fiction films I've seen.
[08:48.74]W: Wasn't it?
[08:49.96]M: No, not at all.
[08:51.92]Oh, the effects were very good.
[08:54.25]W: Yes, I thought they were marvelous,
[08:57.46]especially the battle in space, incredible.
[09:01.23]M: Yes, but I was going to say
[09:03.59]I thought the acting was terrible.
[09:06.59]W: Yes. I suppose Jason was too good to be true.
[09:09.96]And what was the name of the baddy?
[09:12.26]M: Cargon?
[09:13.66]W: Yeah. Cargon was really evil, wasn't he?
[09:16.52]But I suppose that's what these films are all about
[09:20.39]---good triumphing over evil.
[09:22.29]And the characters have to be black and white.
[09:25.39]M: Well, yes, but not always.
[09:28.82]War of the Worlds wasn't like that, for example.
[09:32.31]Anyway, you enjoyed the film.
[09:34.67]That's most important.
[09:36.32]W: Yes, I did. Thanks for taking me.
[09:40.26]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:45.65]8. What does the man say about science fiction films?
[10:05.87]9. What sort of film does the woman like?
[10:23.10]10. What opinion do the speakers share about 
[10:27.05]the film they have just seen?
[10:42.06]11. What do we learn about Jason and Cargon?
[10:59.90]Conversation Two
[11:02.42]M: Can I ask you about your evening class?
[11:05.86]What class do you go to?
[11:08.36]W: Car maintenance.
[11:10.53]M: What night of the week is it on?
[11:12.68]W: Wednesday night.
[11:14.09]M: And how long does it last?
[11:15.76]W: Well, it's supposed to start at 6:00,
[11:18.88]but that's a bit of problem
[11:20.55]because people have difficulty getting through the traffic.
[11:24.60]So we start at 6:30 and then it goes on until 9 o'clock.
[11:29.51]M: And what was your reason for wanting to do the class?
[11:34.00]W: Well, I just bought my first car
[11:37.80]and I don't know anything about cars.
[11:40.05]So I thought it was a good opportunity to learn.
[11:43.59]I guess most people in the class are in the same situation.
[11:47.42]M: Um, and what do you actually do?
[11:50.84]Do you bring the car along to the class?
[11:53.62]W: Yes, we do. 
[11:55.22]And in the first part of the lesson,
[11:57.43]the first half hour,
[11:58.75]the man who runs the class will go through
[12:01.25]some particular part of the car, and we'll learn about it.
[12:05.31]And then we spend the rest of the time,
[12:07.62]actually working on our own cars, the same problem.
[12:11.72]M: And how many people are there in the class?
[12:14.88]W: Um, I think 16, but three quarters of them are women.
[12:20.45]It's quite interesting
[12:22.17]because the man is obviously used to teaching man.
[12:25.21]And he always starts his sentence by saying,
[12:27.67]"Wow, you chaps will know..."
[12:30.75]And then he stops and says,
[12:32.82]"Oh, and you women, you ladies, but...  er..."
[12:37.02]M: Um... sounds funny.
[12:39.24]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:44.50]12. What does the woman say about her evening class?
[13:02.68]13. Why did the woman want to attend the class?
[13:20.48]14. What do the people who attend the class do 
[13:24.87]in the first part of the lesson?
[13:40.08]15. What do we learn about the participants in the class?
[13:58.42]Section C
[13:59.85]Directions: In this section,
[14:02.16]you will hear three passages.
[14:04.02]At the end of each passage,
[14:06.08]you will hear three or four questions.
[14:08.85]Both the passage and the questions
[14:10.94]will be spoken only once.
[14:13.58]After you hear a question,
[14:15.35]you must choose the best answer
[14:17.91]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:23.84]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:27.49]with a single line through the centre.
[14:31.10]Passage One
[14:32.81]We don't choose friends on the basis of
[14:35.97]how much money they have, of course,
[14:38.23]but vast differences can be disturbing to both sides.
[14:43.02]Erin, for example, is single,
[14:45.73]and earns a very good salary.
[14:48.09]Her friend, Pat, a divorced mother of three,
[14:52.11]is struggling to make ends meet.
[14:55.08]"We are both frequent theater-goers,"
[14:58.69]Erin explains, "and I'd gladly pay for two tickets,
[15:03.03]just to have Pat's company at plays in concerts,
[15:06.70]but she won't go anywhere unless she can pay her own way.
[15:11.94]I hate to go alone, so we both stay home.
[15:16.31]It all seems so silly."
[15:18.42]Pat sees the situation differently.
[15:22.95]After an unhappy marriage to a man who tried to control her
[15:27.49]without considering her wishes and feelings,
[15:30.14]she says, "it's very important to me to carry my own weight.
[15:34.65]I'm not comfortable in any relationship where all I do is take."
[15:39.64]The difficult situation finally changed when Erin moved recently.
[15:47.18]Pat's children were with their father,
[15:49.98]so she took a picnic lunch to her friend's new place,
[15:53.98]then spent the day helping her unpack and get settled.
[15:57.98]"I was so grateful," Erin says,
[16:01.33]"that I persuaded Pat to
[16:03.48]let me return the favour in my own way
[16:06.18]with season tickets to our little theater group.
[16:09.38]I think she's beginning to recognize that
[16:12.33]she contributes as much to our friendship as I do."
[16:16.80]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:22.99]16. What do we learn about Pat?
[16:40.44]17. What draws Erin and Pat together?
[16:58.08]18. What does Erin do to return Pat's favour?
[17:15.38]19. What do we learn about friendship from the passage?
[17:33.82]Passage Two
[17:36.03]Sun School in the town of Ashbert in England
[17:39.17]is a day school for children aged 10 to 18.
[17:43.73]It is based on the value of social equality
[17:47.04]between students and staff, and has few rules.
[17:51.34]Sun School believes that
[17:53.64]the healthy growth of a child
[17:55.24]is more important than academic success.
[17:59.52]It offers a variety of lessons and activities
[18:02.29]for students to choose from and free time
[18:05.39]for children to follow their own interests.
[18:08.13]Classes are small,
[18:09.79]and based on the individual needs of each child.
[18:13.44]The timetable is fixed,
[18:15.06]but democratically decided,
[18:17.40]and students are expected to attend.
[18:19.69]The weekly school meeting is
[18:22.61]at the center of the way Sun School is organized.
[18:26.74]It makes all the decisions that
[18:28.49]affect the school, including rules, the timetable
[18:32.44]and accepting or rejecting new students and teachers.
[18:36.29]Participating in these meetings gives the children
[18:39.44]an understanding of democratic decision-making
[18:43.33]and helps them develop their skills of argument and persuasion.
[18:47.58]The most important advantage of the school meeting is
[18:51.18]that it shows the children that the school is really theirs.
[18:54.99]They have the right to decide on changes.
[18:57.68]And the school's success or failure
[19:00.24]depends on their decisions and their behavior.
[19:03.66]Sun School employs no cooking or cleaning staff.
[19:07.82]These jobs are done by the students and teachers.
[19:11.03]Decorating and simple repairs are also done by the students.
[19:15.98]It is believed that
[19:17.81]for the school to truly belong to those who use it,
[19:20.86]they must take responsibility for its maintenance.
[19:24.96]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:30.27]20. What value is Sun School based on?
[19:49.39]21. What is characteristic of the school's decision-making process?
[20:07.40]22. Why does Sun School ask students to do its maintenance?
[20:27.90]Passage Three
[20:29.35]Well, to continue, as I mentioned earlier,
[20:33.11]there is also research that demonstrates that
[20:36.32]individuals perform worse, not better,
[20:40.20]on tasks when other people are there.
[20:43.10]R. W. Hubbert did an interesting experiment.
[20:47.55]He had his subjects learn a finger maze.
[20:51.20]This is a game in which
[20:53.36]you indicate with your finger the way
[20:56.02]through a complex system of passages or paths.
[20:59.41]The subjects who had an audience did worse than
[21:03.51]the subjects who did alone.
[21:05.87]Now how can we explain these very different results?
[21:10.82]It seemed very confusing for a long time.
[21:14.33]Social psychologist, John Roberts,
[21:18.05]finally cleared up the confusion about
[21:20.87]why people sometimes perform better
[21:23.69]and sometimes worse in front of an audience.
[21:27.24]Roberts found that the presence of an audience facilitates
[21:32.01]what you already know how to do.
[21:34.72]That is, if you know what you are doing,
[21:37.88]having an audience helps you do it better.
[21:41.33]But if you don't already know how to do something,
[21:44.93]you will probably make some mistakes
[21:47.80]and you will make mistakes for a longer time
[21:50.81]if you have an audience.
[21:52.66]That's exactly what happened to the subjects
[21:55.96]who were learning the finger maze.
[21:58.21]So, if you are doing well,
[22:02.33]having an audience increases the chances
[22:04.73]that you will continue to do well.
[22:07.56]If you are doing badly,
[22:09.57]having an audience increases the chances
[22:12.23]that you will continue to do badly.
[22:15.64]Roberts cleverly pointed out that
[22:18.52]when you are first learning something,
[22:20.47]you are better off working alone than practicing with other people.
[22:26.11]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:32.98]23. What did the speaker probably discuss 
[22:37.90]before coming to this part of the talk?
[22:53.67]24. When does the presence of an audience facilitate your performance 
[22:59.04]according to Roberts?
[23:13.83]25. What does Roberts think is a better way to learn new things?
[23:32.71]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

[00:14.72]College English Test - Band 4
[00:19.49]Part II  Listening Comprehension
[00:22.00]Section A
[00:24.22]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.38]you will hear three news reports.
[00:30.15]At the end of each news report,
[00:32.51]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:35.52]Both the news report and the questions
[00:38.15]will be spoken only once.
[00:40.78]After you hear a question,
[00:42.88]you must choose the best answer
[00:45.03]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:49.47]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:53.79]with a single line through the centre.
[00:57.26]News Report One
[00:59.97]One of Google's self-driving cars 
[01:02.28]crashed into a bus in California last month. 
[01:05.64]There were no injuries. 
[01:07.42]It is not the first time 
[01:09.07]one of Google's famed self-driving cars has been involved in a crash, 
[01:14.09]but it may be the first time it has caused one.
[01:17.74]On February 14th, 
[01:20.79]the self-driving car, travelling at two miles per hour, 
[01:24.30]pulled out in front of a public bus going fifteen miles per hour.
[01:29.46]The man in the Google vehicle reported that 
[01:32.34]he assumed the bus would slow down to let the car out, 
[01:36.03]and so he did not switch to the manual mode.
[01:39.53]In a statement, Google said: 
[01:41.73]"We clearly bear some responsibility, 
[01:44.59]because if our car hadn't moved, there wouldn't have been a crash."
[01:49.38]"That said, our test driver believed 
[01:52.71]the bus was going to slow 
[01:54.19]or stop to allow us to merge into the traffic, 
[01:58.04]and that there would be sufficient space to do that."
[02:01.96]The company's self-driving cars have done well 
[02:05.23]over a million miles across various states in the US, 
[02:09.38]and until now have only reported minor accidents.
[02:15.10]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[02:20.61]1. According to Google, what was the cause of the accident?
[02:39.33]2. How have Google's self-driving cars performed so far?
[02:58.32]News Report Two
[02:59.85]Thousands of bees left a town 
[03:03.35]after landing on the back of a car 
[03:05.57]when their queen got stuck in its boot.
[03:08.91]Tom Moses, who works at a nearby national park, 
[03:13.50]noticed a "brown patch" on the back of the car 
[03:16.68]after the owner parked it to do some shopping. 
[03:19.96]When he looked closer, 
[03:22.33]he realised it was a huge group of bees.
[03:26.44]Moses said: "I have never seen that many bees in one spot. 
[03:30.91]It was very unusual. 
[03:32.95]They were very close together 
[03:35.21]and there were a lot of noise and movement.
[03:38.40]It was interesting to see such a strange sight, 
[03:42.05]but there were a lot of people around 
[03:44.71]and I was a bit worried of the bees and the people stopping to look. 
[03:49.18]I thought that someone might do something stupid."
[03:52.89]Moses called two local bee specialists 
[03:56.18]who helped remove the bees by attracting them into a box. 
[04:00.92]Moses spent three hours looking after the bees 
[04:04.73]- and was stung five times.
[04:07.75]He said: "My stings are a bit painful, 
[04:10.99]but I am pleased that all worked out and I could help. 
[04:14.12]People need to realise that bees are valuable 
[04:17.13]and they should be looked after."
[04:20.10]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[04:26.25]3. What do we learn about Tom Moses?
[04:43.96]4. What do we know about the bees on the back of the car?
[05:02.82]News Report Three
[05:04.53]A new species of snake has been discovered 
[05:07.33]on a remote island in the Bahamas.
[05:10.41]Scientists identified 20 of the one meter-long snakes 
[05:14.88]during two trips to the Caribbean islands. 
[05:17.76]The second trip was made in October last year.
[05:20.90]One of the creatures made a dramatic appearance 
[05:24.48]by moving on to the head of the team leader as he slept.
[05:28.69]The snake has been named silver boa 
[05:31.35]because it is metal colored 
[05:33.47]and the first specimen found was climbing a silver palm tree.
[05:38.48]The team was led by Dr. Graham Reynolds, from Harvard University. 
[05:43.88]The scientist confirmed the snake was a previously unknown species 
[05:48.54]after conducting a genetic analysis of tissue samples.
[05:53.53]Commenting on the find, 
[05:55.48]snake expert Robert Henderson 
[05:57.82]from the Milwaukee Museum of Natural History, said: 
[06:01.64]"Worldwide new species of frogs 
[06:05.01]are being discovered and described quite regularly. 
[06:08.84]New species of snakes, however, are much rarer."
[06:14.12]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[06:19.51]5. What is the news report mainly about?
[06:37.98]6. What do we learn about the scientific team leader?
[06:55.58]7. How did the newly discovered creature get its name?
[07:13.51]Section B
[07:14.82]Directions: In this section,
[07:17.32]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:20.88]At the end of each conversation,
[07:23.27]you will hear four questions.
[07:26.26]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:29.06]will be spoken only once.
[07:31.38]After you hear a question,
[07:33.96]you must choose the best answer
[07:36.38]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:41.94]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:47.16]with a single line through the centre.
[07:50.71]Conversation One
[07:52.56]W: Did you enjoy your stay with us? Mr. Brown?
[07:56.07]M: Yes, very much. I had a wonderful time here. 
[07:59.92]Now I am going to the airport. 
[08:01.98]My flight leaves in less than two hours, 
[08:04.84]so could you tell me what is the quickest way to get there?
[08:08.55]W: Well, we can call a taxi for you. 
[08:11.88]We also have a free airport shuttle service. 
[08:15.45]M: That sounds great, 
[08:17.51]but will the shuttle get me to the airport in time?
[08:20.21]W: Yes, it should. The next shuttle leaves in 15 minutes, 
[08:24.62]and it takes some 25 minutes to get to the airport.
[08:28.72]M: Fantastic. I'll just wait in the lobby. 
[08:32.33]Will you please let me know when it's leaving?
[08:34.74]W: Of course, sir. 
[08:36.43]M: Now, I would like to settle my mini-bar bill. 
[08:39.45]How much is that?
[08:40.90]W: Let's see. It comes to 37 dollars and 50 cents. 
[08:46.34]How would you like to pay for it?
[08:48.94]M: I'll pay with my credit card, thanks, 
[08:52.29]but I'll need a receipt so I can charge it to my company.
[08:55.96]W: Absolutely. Here you are, sir. 
[08:58.84]If you like, you can leave your bags with the porter 
[09:02.72]and he can load them onto the shuttle for you when it arrives.
[09:07.03]M: That would be great, thank you.
[09:09.09]W: Would you like to leave a comment on our webpage 
[09:11.49]when you have time? 
[09:12.96]M: Sure, I had a really good stay here 
[09:15.56]and I'd like to recommend your hotel to my friends and colleagues.
[09:19.07]W: That's very kind of you. 
[09:21.15]Thank you again for staying at Sheraton Hotel.
[09:24.57]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:31.52]8. Why does the man ask about the quickest way to the airport?
[09:51.36]9. How is the man going to pay his bill?
[10:08.71]10. What did the man ask the woman to do?
[10:25.69]11.What favor does the woman ask of the man?
[10:43.35]Conversation Two
[10:44.99]M: You know, 
[10:46.65]Ben's given up making those terrible faces he used to make. 
[10:50.76]The other day, he came home from school almost in tears. 
[10:55.77]His teacher said if he went on like that, 
[10:59.03]his face would get stuck when the winds changed.
[11:02.70]W: And he believed her?
[11:04.55]M: Yeah, he's only a little boy. 
[11:07.01]Don't you remember all those things we used to believe 
[11:10.52]when we were little? 
[11:11.82]I remember my aunt Mary used to say 
[11:15.26]if you swallow a cherry stone, 
[11:17.96]a tree would grow out of your mouth. 
[11:21.00]And I'm still terrified today, sort of subconsciously. 
[11:25.31]You know, if I swallow one by mistake...
[11:28.56]W: Yeah, I suppose you're right. 
[11:30.91]The one that used to get me was that 
[11:34.25]swans could break your leg when they blow of the wing.
[11:37.79]M: They can, can't they? 
[11:40.06]I always thought they could.
[11:42.02]W: No, they are not that strong. 
[11:44.48]But there's another one even more terrifying. 
[11:47.04]That is, if you put a post stamp on upside down, 
[11:51.01]you will go to prison.
[11:52.89]M: No, never heard of that. 
[11:54.95]But my grandmother was a terror for that kind of thing. 
[11:58.86]For example, she would say, 
[12:01.83]you'll get a spot on your tongue if you tell a lie. 
[12:04.79]If you eat stale bread, your hair will curl. 
[12:08.80]And here is one more. 
[12:10.56]We went on a campaign trip once in Italy, 
[12:13.87]and my wife spent the whole time 
[12:16.18]worrying about bats getting into her hair. 
[12:19.19]She said her grandmother reckoned 
[12:22.04]you had to shave your head to get it out. 
[12:24.59]My wife was really terrified.
[12:26.60]W: Silly, isn't it? 
[12:28.44]But that's how some parents try to keep their kids 
[12:31.82]from doing the wrong thing 
[12:33.78]or getting into trouble.
[12:36.97]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:41.79]12. What does the man say about Ben?
[12:59.53]13. What did aunt Mary used to do when the man was a child?
[13:18.51]14. What does the woman believe swans could do?
[13:36.33]15. What did the grandmother of the man's wife say?
[13:54.03]Section C
[13:55.39]Directions: In this section,
[13:57.42]you will hear three passages.
[13:59.78]At the end of each passage,
[14:01.64]you will hear three or four questions.
[14:04.39]Both the passage and the questions
[14:06.54]will be spoken only once.
[14:08.85]After you hear a question,
[14:10.82]you must choose the best answer
[14:13.47]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:19.08]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:23.07]with a single line through the centre.
[14:26.20]Passage One
[14:28.91]If I could go back in history and live when I liked, 
[14:34.16]I wouldn't go back very far. 
[14:36.57]In fact, I'd like to relive a period I've already lived - the 1960s.
[14:43.60]I was in my twenties, and everything was being renewed. 
[14:48.27]People would come in out of a formal and almost Victorian attitude, 
[14:53.71]and you really felt anything was possible. 
[14:57.13]Meeting people was the thing, 
[14:58.84]and you went to coffee bars 
[15:01.05]where you met friends and spent the evening. 
[15:04.07]The cinema, the theater, 
[15:06.88]all that was very exciting with new things coming out. 
[15:11.03]In fact, we seemed to be out all the time! 
[15:15.39]I don't really remember working - of course, I was a student 
[15:20.42]- or sitting around at home very much. 
[15:23.03]That just wasn't where the scene was, even eating! 
[15:27.40]It was the first time ordinary people started going out to eat. 
[15:31.90]We were beginning to be adventurous about food, 
[15:36.01]but we were more interested in meeting people 
[15:39.09]than in eating or drinking. 
[15:41.74]And dress, yes, that was the revolution. 
[15:45.04]I mean, girls went around in really short skirts, 
[15:49.10]and wore flowers in their hair. 
[15:51.21]And men were in jeans, and could wear their hair long too. 
[15:56.02]It was a wonderful period. 
[15:58.22]It was like living in an age you could never have imagined, 
[16:01.97]and that never has come back. 
[16:04.87]We didn't have much money, but it didn't matter. 
[16:08.12]And there was plenty of opportunity 
[16:10.39]to do whatever you felt like doing.
[16:13.26]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:19.58]16. Why does the speaker say he would like to relive the 1960s?
[16:39.87]17. What does the speaker say was the most popular thing 
[16:44.88]to do at that time?
[17:00.08]18. What do we learn about the speaker?
[17:17.21]Passage Two
[17:17.92]Dogs, man's best friends, 
[17:21.11]have a clear strategy for dealing with angry owners - they look away. 
[17:27.12]New research shows that 
[17:28.95]dogs limit their eye contact with angry humans. 
[17:32.40]The scientists suggest this may be an attempt to calm humans down. 
[17:38.16]This behavior may have evolved 
[17:40.27]as dogs gradually learn 
[17:42.58]they could benefit from avoiding conflicts with humans.
[17:46.59]To conduct the tests, 
[17:48.74]the University of Helsinki researchers trained 31 dogs 
[17:53.26]to rest in front of a video screen. 
[17:55.92]Facial photos of dogs and humans 
[17:59.20]were displayed on the screen for 1.5 seconds. 
[18:03.67]They show threatening, pleasant and neutral expressions. 
[18:07.58]Nearby cameras tracked the dogs' eye movements.
[18:12.29]Dogs in the study looked most at the eyes of humans and other dogs 
[18:17.37]to sense their emotions. 
[18:19.43]When dogs looked at expressions of angry dogs, 
[18:22.58]their eyes rested more on the mouth, 
[18:25.30]perhaps to interpret the threatening expressions. 
[18:28.59]And when looking at angry humans, 
[18:31.15]they tended to turn away their gaze.
[18:33.67]Dogs may have learned to detect threat signs from humans 
[18:38.03]and respond by trying to make peace. 
[18:41.28]According to researcher Sanni Somppi, 
[18:44.59]avoiding conflicts may have helped dogs 
[18:47.19]develop better bonds with humans.
[18:49.70]The researchers also note that dogs scan faces as a whole 
[18:53.72]to sense how people are feeling, 
[18:56.17]instead of focusing on a given feature. 
[18:59.27]They suggest this indicates that 
[19:01.84]dogs aren't sensing emotions from a single feature, 
[19:05.44]but piecing together information 
[19:07.60]from all facial features just as humans do.
[19:11.86]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[19:17.92]19. What do dogs do when they are faced with angry humans?
[19:37.78]20. What does a dog do when it sees the expressions of angry dogs?
[19:57.27]21. How does a dog sense people's feelings?
[20:15.45]Passage Three 
[20:17.56]Winter in many places is very cold. 
[20:20.32]There is lots of snow around and the ground freezes, 
[20:24.59]which can make life difficult for animals. 
[20:28.03]People in cold places live in warm houses and have learned to adapt. 
[20:33.78]What do animals do? 
[20:35.98]There are three main ways 
[20:37.57]that animals survive the cold in winter-sleep, adapt or migrate.
[20:44.26]Some animals, such as bears, frogs and snakes, sleep all winter. 
[20:50.97]They sleep very deeply and need little or no food. 
[20:55.88]While sleeping, 
[20:56.90]their body temperature drops and their heartbeat slows down. 
[21:01.53]To prepare for this before winter, 
[21:04.27]these animals eat extra food to become fat, 
[21:08.24]which gives them the energy they need while they sleep. 
[21:12.20]Other animals adapt, 
[21:14.00]for example, by staying active in winter. 
[21:18.17]It is often hard for them to find food. 
[21:21.03]So some animals, such as mice, 
[21:24.15]collect extra food before winter and hide it. 
[21:28.56]When winter comes, 
[21:30.41]they return to the hiding places to eat the food. 
[21:34.27]Some animals grow thicker fur 
[21:36.63]or live in tree holes or underground to stay warm. 
[21:40.83]Some birds migrate by flying to a warmer place for the winter 
[21:45.41]where they can find more food. Some fly very long distances, 
[21:50.68]including one kind of bird 
[21:52.74]that flies from the remote north of the world 
[21:56.29]all the way to the distant south. 
[21:59.34]Some birds fly in groups for safety, while others fly alone. 
[22:03.99]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:11.57]22. What does the speaker say about animals in winter?
[22:31.13]23. What do we learn about animals that sleep through winter?
[22:50.25]24. How do animals like mice adapt to the severe winter?
[23:09.53]25. Why do some birds fly in groups 
[23:13.84]when migrating according to the speaker?
[23:29.67]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

[00:18.84]Part II  Listening Comprehension
[00:21.76]Section A
[00:23.92]Directions: In this section,
[00:27.48]you will hear three news reports.
[00:30.09]At the end of each news report,
[00:32.62]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:35.49]Both the news report and the questions
[00:38.09]will be spoken only once.
[00:41.02]After you hear a question,
[00:43.09]you must choose the best answer
[00:45.04]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:49.91]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:54.05]with a single line through the centre.
[00:57.66]News Report One
[01:00.17]Automakers and tech companies are working hard
[01:03.37]to offer the first true self-driving car,
[01:06.82]but 75% of drivers say they wouldn't feel safe in such a vehicle.
[01:12.68]Still, 60% of drivers would like to get some kind of self-driving feature,
[01:19.00]such as automatic braking or self-parking
[01:22.75]the next time they buy a new car.
[01:25.68]The attitudes are published in a new AAA survey of 1,800 drivers.
[01:32.04]Advocates of self-driving cars argue
[01:35.65]they would be safer than in cars driven by humans
[01:39.34]because they wouldn't get distracted or drive when tired.
[01:43.00]But those surveyed by AAA say they trust their own driving skills.
[01:48.64]Many feel the technology is too new and unproven.
[01:52.68]John Nielsen,
[01:54.16]AAA's managing director of automotive engineering and repair,
[01:58.67]said tests suggest drivers may be overestimating their own abilities.
[02:04.22]He also believes they will be more likely to trust self-driving cars
[02:09.14]as they become more familiar with features
[02:12.11]such as automatic braking or parking.
[02:15.51]He estimated
[02:16.86]that the "comfort level" will increase considerably in five to ten years.
[02:21.53]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[02:27.81]1. What is the finding of the AAA survey?
[02:48.62]2. What does John Nielsen say about self-driving cars?
[03:09.20]News Report Two
[03:11.15]One dog has been killed and multiple dogs have been injured
[03:16.11]by a snowmobile driver
[03:17.96]in what appears to be an intentional attack on competitors
[03:22.49]in the Iditarod Race in Alaska.
[03:26.39]Aliy Zirkle was the first to report an attack.
[03:30.10]A snowmobile driver had "repeatedly attempted to harm her and her team,"
[03:35.10]and one of Zirkle's dogs had received a non-life-threatening injury.
[03:40.61]Zirkle reported the attack
[03:42.50]when she arrived in Nulato, Alaska in the early hour of the morning.
[03:47.40]Then Jeff King, a four-time champion reported a similar attack.
[03:53.76]His team was hit by a snowmobile driver,
[03:56.52]injuring several dogs and killing a 3-year-old male dog.
[04:01.48]Reporter Zachariah Hughe says that neither King nor Zirkle was injured.
[04:07.56]Although this incident very much alters the race of the two participants
[04:12.40]competing for a win
[04:13.86]both are going to continue on their way toward the finished land.
[04:18.18]Alaska State Troopers released a statement
[04:21.04]saying they've arrested Arnold Demoski, 26.
[04:25.09]He faces trial on several charges.
[04:28.43]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[04:35.74]3. What is the news report mainly about?
[04:55.99]4. What do we learn about Jeff King?
[05:15.13]News Report Three
[05:17.09]A tour boat turned over off the coast of Nicaragua,
[05:20.62]killing at least 13 people and leaving more passengers missing,
[05:25.01]officials said.
[05:26.71]The boat was carrying 32 people ---
[05:29.10]25 Costa Ricans, four Americans and three Nicaraguans.
[05:35.05]The 13 dead were all Costa Rican, the foreign ministry said.
[05:39.46]The boat,
[05:40.52]traveling between Nicaragua's Big Corn Island and Little Corn Island,
[05:45.51]turned over Saturday near the larger island.
[05:48.91]Some passengers remain missing,
[05:51.39]the Costa Rican foreign ministry said,
[05:53.87]but did not specify how many.
[05:56.87]A local radio said an unspecified number of people were rescued,
[06:01.33]including the tour boat's owner, Hilario Blandon.
[06:06.14]Nicaraguan naval authorities had banned sea travel in the area
[06:10.64]because of bad weather and strong winds,
[06:12.91]but the tour boat proceeded anyway.
[06:15.73]Blandon, the boat's owner, has been arrested by Nicaraguan authorities,
[06:21.45]the state-run news agency said.
[06:24.35]Both he and a crew member,
[06:26.30]are being investigated for unintentional murder
[06:29.86]and exposing people to danger,
[06:32.32]according to police.
[06:34.46]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[06:39.47]5. What happened to the tour boat sailing off the Nicaraguan coast?
[07:01.30]6. How many people was the boat carrying?
[07:20.71]7. What do we know about the owner of the boat?
[07:40.57]Section B
[07:41.82]Directions: In this section,
[07:44.19]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:47.69]At the end of each conversation,
[07:50.31]you will hear four questions.
[07:53.27]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:56.47]will be spoken only once.
[07:58.81]After you hear a question,
[08:01.37]you must choose the best answer
[08:03.62]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[08:09.25]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[08:14.15]with a single line through the centre.
[08:17.91]Conversation One
[08:21.12]M: Hi, Susan. You are looking very smart today.
[08:24.01]W: I always look smart, James.
[08:26.51]Actually I'm on my way to a job interview.
[08:30.21]M: What job?
[08:31.69]Oh, you mean for the summer holidays?
[08:34.11]W:Yeah, there is only two weeks to go.
[08:37.01]I've got a second interview with that big foreign accountancy firm
[08:41.29]in the city center.
[08:42.60]You know the one.
[08:43.92]M: That's fantastic.
[08:45.32]W: The record is just helping out with data input. You know.
[08:49.88]But the pay isn't too bad. It might suit you too.
[08:53.78]I know they have at least two temporary positions available.
[08:57.94]And I don't think they have anyone else yet.
[09:00.69]M:Em, if they take you on,
[09:03.78]tell them you know a friend who'd be really good too.
[09:07.74]I really need the money and the experience will look good on my resume.
[09:12.95]Maybe we'll be working together --- the dream team.
[09:16.57]W: Ok, we'll do.
[09:18.42]If the boss likes me, I'll mention it.
[09:21.68]It will be good to have someone around, who I know.
[09:25.21]I'll phone you afterwards.
[09:27.46]But perhaps you should put in an application anyway.
[09:31.07]M: Thanks, Susan.
[09:32.78]That's great. Listen, do you want a lift to the city?
[09:36.28]I have my dad's car today and nothing else to do this morning.
[09:40.81]W: Sure, thanks James.
[09:43.02]M: Let's go then, the car is over there.
[09:45.66]W:By the way, how is your knowledge of accountancy?
[09:48.90]The interviewer may ask you about it.
[09:51.59]M: No problem, I think I can survive.
[09:54.42]I might just have to review a few accountancy terms.
[09:58.33]Maybe you can give me a practice interview first.
[10:01.47]W: Of course, let's go then.
[10:03.83]Don't want to be late.
[10:05.50]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[10:10.02]8. Where will Susan probably get a job?
[10:31.28]9. What will Susan's future job involve?
[10:50.42]10. Why does James want the job in that company?
[11:10.48]11. What does James say he would have to do to prepare for the interview?
[11:32.02]Conversation Two
[11:33.14]W: There is new data out today
[11:35.40]that confirms that many Americans are not good at math.
[11:39.46]And when it comes to everyday technology skills,
[11:42.61]we are dead last when compared to other developed countries.
[11:46.97]Here's Gabrielle Emanuel of National Public Radio.
[11:51.01]M: Let's start with the bad news
[11:53.76]that Americans are terrible at technology skills ---
[11:57.41]using email, naming a file on a computer,
[12:01.11]using a link on a webpage or just texting someone.
[12:05.68]W: No country scored below the U.S.
[12:09.04]M: Only one country. Poland performed as pooly as we did.
[12:14.46]Who came out the first --- Japan did the best and then Finland.
[12:20.22]If you look at data about reading and math,
[12:23.97]you'll notice something interesting.
[12:26.48]Young adults who went to college or graduate school were doing pretty well.
[12:32.67]In literacy,
[12:34.08]they were actually doing better than their peers in other countries.
[12:38.05]W: So that's a bit of good news.
[12:41.06]M: But when you looked at Americans who have a high school diploma,
[12:44.95]they looked a lot like other countries' high school dropouts.
[12:49.16]We had a lot of work to do.
[12:52.12]That is especially true when it comes to math.
[12:55.38]You go to the store, and there's a sale.
[12:58.48]Buy one; get the second one half off.
[13:01.70]You decide to buy two. How much do you pay?
[13:05.61]W:You mean high school graduates can't do this task in general?
[13:10.61]M: You're right.
[13:11.82]What does that tell us about our education system?
[13:15.04]Well, it tells us that
[13:17.54]we need to think about the preparedness of our students
[13:21.14]as they're leaving high school.
[13:22.99]W: Right. And schools, employers,
[13:25.95]in fact, we all need to do something about it.
[13:28.70]Thank you, Gabrielle.
[13:30.46]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[13:36.12]12. What does the man say about Americans?
[13:55.09]13. Who performed the best in technology skills according to the man?
[14:17.71]14. In what aspect did American college students perform well?
[14:39.50]15. What do we learn
[14:42.10]from the conversation about American high school education?
[15:01.37]Section C
[15:02.77]Directions: In this section,
[15:04.99]you will hear three passages.
[15:07.04]At the end of each passage,
[15:09.09]you will hear three or four questions.
[15:11.80]Both the passage and the questions
[15:14.15]will be spoken only once.
[15:16.45]After you hear a question,
[15:18.61]you must choose the best answer
[15:21.22]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[15:26.96]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[15:30.87]with a single line through the centre.
[15:34.17]Passage One
[15:35.58]Wild carrots probably evolved with the other flowering plants,
[15:39.90]about 360 million years ago.
[15:42.95]Like apples, carrots are native to Central Asia.
[15:47.76]That's why horses, which also come from Central Asia,
[15:52.17]like both apples and carrots so much.
[15:56.08]Root wild carrots, the roots are white, small and skinny,
[16:00.78]so you have to pick a lot of wild carrots to get enough to eat.
[16:05.34]Doctors used carrot seeds and roots as medicine,
[16:08.87]on the theory that foods that taste bad must be good for you.
[16:13.35]Around 800 AD,
[16:15.34]people in Central Asia managed to develop a new kind of carrot
[16:19.94]--- a purple carrot ---
[16:21.75]that attracted more interest from international traders.
[16:25.29]Then in the late 1500s,
[16:28.04]food scientists in the Netherlands cultivated
[16:31.66]large, straight, sweet, red carrots like the ones we eat today.
[16:37.48]But people still mostly fed carrots to horses and donkeys and pigs,
[16:42.14]and didn't eat them themselves.
[16:44.69]In the 1600s, people in China used carrots as medicine,
[16:49.03]but they also ate carrots boiled in soup.
[16:52.35]The red color was popular for Chinese New Year celebrations.
[16:56.87]But carrots got their biggest boost during the two World Wars,
[17:01.28]when food shortages forced people to eat them,
[17:04.69]and governments told everyone how healthy carrots were.
[17:08.99]Today, cooler countries grow most of the world's carrots.
[17:14.45]Machines do most of the planting and picking,
[17:17.12]and carrots are easy to store and ship,
[17:19.93]so they are cheap almost everywhere.
[17:23.54]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:30.30]16. What do we learn from the talk about wild carrots?
[17:50.74]17. What does the speaker say about carrots in the late 1500s?
[18:12.72]18. Why did people turn to carrots for food during the two world wars?
[18:34.83]Passage Two
[18:36.19]Katherine loved Facebook.
[18:38.24]With Facebook she could stay connected with her family,
[18:41.99]no matter how far away they were.
[18:44.35]She could see their photos and read their status updates.
[18:48.34]With Facebook she could keep her relatives up-to-date
[18:52.00]on what she was doing.
[18:53.75]Another thing Katherine loved about Facebook was that
[18:57.72]she didn't have to think about time zones when updating family.
[19:01.57]Whenever she called her parents or other relatives,
[19:05.52]she always had to think about the time difference
[19:08.92]so that she wouldn't wake someone up or call
[19:11.93]when she knew they were at church.
[19:13.84]Facebook was so convenient.
[19:16.14]When Katherine joined Facebook,
[19:18.35]some of her classmates at high school started to add her as a friend.
[19:23.21]At first, this didn't bother her.
[19:26.16]She loved learning about the success of people she knew
[19:29.97]when she was just a teenager.
[19:31.98]She loved finding out people were getting married,
[19:34.90]having babies, and traveling.
[19:38.12]Soon however,
[19:39.72]Katherine found herself comparing herself with the people
[19:43.18]she was reading about on Facebook.
[19:45.88]It began to make her feel bad
[19:48.59]that some people seemed to be doing so much better than she was.
[19:52.96]She was also spending a lot of time on Facebook.
[19:56.58]It took a lot of time and energy to keep up with everyone's status updates.
[20:02.80]Katherine started to think.
[20:04.96]She looked at the list of over 500 friends she had on Facebook
[20:10.21]and realized some of them were not really friends at all.
[20:15.32]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:21.14]19. What was one particular convenience Katherine loved of Facebook?
[20:43.43]20. How did Katherine feel
[20:46.20]when her classmates added her as a Facebook friend?
[21:05.71]21. What made Katherine feel bad about herself later on?
[21:27.06]Passage Three
[21:28.45]Do you know where a mule comes from?
[21:31.26]It is the child of a donkey and a horse.
[21:34.23]Mules have strong muscles like horses
[21:37.95]but they eat less, can work longer, and are gentler, like donkeys.
[21:43.14]George Washington was the first person in the United States
[21:47.77]to own mules.
[21:49.17]He had heard that mules made good farm animals
[21:52.84]and he contacted the U.S. ambassador in Spain to ask about them.
[21:58.66]In 1785,
[22:00.61]King Charles III of Spain sent Washington a male donkey as a gift.
[22:05.92]That male donkey became the father of the mule industry in the U.S.
[22:11.69]Every April, Maury County holds a Mule Day celebration.
[22:16.34]Held in Columbia, Tennessee,
[22:19.46]Mule Day had its beginning as "Breeder's Day" in the 1840s.
[22:24.47]Farmers and farm animal breeders would bring their animals to market
[22:29.02]every April to show, buy, and trade.
[22:31.92]This was an important business before the days of tractors,
[22:35.98]when many families made a living from farming
[22:39.53]and mules were used as work animal.
[22:42.45]Eventually, tractors began to replace mules,
[22:45.88]making them less in demand.
[22:48.12]A parade was added to Mule Day in 1934 to attract more people.
[22:54.39]Over the years other activities have been added,
[22:58.29]and today more than 200,000 people show up each year
[23:03.03]to watch and participate.
[23:05.38]If you visit during Mule Day Celebrations,
[23:08.70]you might see mule-driving contests, square dances,
[23:14.14]or shows, or even tree-cutting competition.
[23:18.65]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[23:25.17]22. What does the speaker say about mules？
[23:46.08]23. What do we learn about the donkey
[23:50.17]which is said to be the father of the US mule industry?
[24:09.52]24. What did farmers usually do on Mule day in the 1840s?
[24:32.21]25. What made mules less in demand in America?
[24:52.98]This is the end of listening comprehension.

[01:41.23]In this respect, in March, 
[01:43.52]the ministries of finance, science and technology 
[01:47.17]released a funding guideline for research projects. 
[01:51.06]It said

[03:20.29]Rats and birds reportedly also died after swallowing the poison, 
[03:24.73]amid fears children might pick it up. 
[03:27.88]The Association of Stray Cats has reported the events to police 
[03:32.35]in the hope that autopsies can be carried out. 
[03:36.11]"The atmosphere has become hateful, nobody trusts anyone," 
[03:40.64]a villager named only as Geneviève was quoted 
[03:44.68]as saying by French daily Ouest-France. 
[03:47.83]"We're all afraid a child might ingest some of this mystery poison."
[03:54.76]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[04:02.03]3. What makes the seaside resort on edge?  
[04:22.07]4. What do the villagers fear?
[04:40.69]News Report Three
[04:44.42]At least 22 people have been killed 
[04:47.19]after a bus collided with a truck 
[04:49.59]in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. 
[04:53.74]The crash happened early on Monday 
[04:56.53]in the city of Bareilly, 155 miles from the state capital, Lucknow. 
[05:03.51]A senior police official said 
[05:06.38]all 22 victims had been burned badly 
[05:09.58]and could not be immediately identified. 
[05:12.51]The passenger bus had caught fire following the collision. 
[05:16.33]Police are searching for the driver of the truck. 
[05:20.13]The doors of the bus jammed after the collision, 
[05:23.72]trapping passengers inside. 
[05:26.22]A few people managed to escape

[07:57.94]I just like to go over some of the things
[08:01.12]that you told police officer Parmer at the bank.
[08:04.37]W: All right.
[08:05.61]M: Well, could you describe the man who robbed the bank
[08:09.41]for this report that we're filling out here?
[08:12.05]Now, anything at all that you can remember
[08:15.16]would be extremely helpful to us.
[08:18.00]W: Well, just, I can only remember basically what I said before.
[08:23.69]M: That's all right.
[08:25.39]W: The man was tall, six foot, and he had dark hair,
[08:30.32]and he had a moustache.
[08:32.37]M: Very good. All right,
[08:34.52]did he have any other distinguishing marks?
[08:37.76]W: Um, no, none that I can remember.
[08:40.50]M: Do you remember how old he was by any chance?
[08:44.50]W: Well, I guess around 30, maybe younger,
[08:48.98]give or take a few years.
[08:50.68]M: Mm, all right.
[08:53.53]Do you remember anything about what he was wearing?
[08:56.00]W: Yes, yes, he had on a dark sweater, a solid color.
[09:02.27]M: OK. Um, anything else that strikes you at the moment?
[09:07.06]W: I remember he was wearing a light shirt under the sweater.
[09:11.16]Yes, yes.
[09:12.92]M: All right, Mrs. Dawson.
[09:15.02]I really appreciate what you've been through today.
[09:18.12]I'm just going to ask you to look at some photographs
[09:21.27]before you leave if you don't mind. It won't take very long.
[09:25.56]Can you do that for me?
[09:26.95]W: Oh, of course.
[09:29.00]M: Would you like to step this way with me, please?
[09:31.66]W: OK, sure.
[09:33.02]M: Thank you.
[09:35.11]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:39.71]8. What do we learn about the woman?
[09:58.54]9. What did the suspect look like?
[10:18.64]10. What did the suspect wear under his sweater?
[10:37.87]11. What did the man finally ask the woman to do?
[10:58.37]Conversation Two
[11:00.46]W: Good morning. I'm calling about the job
[11:03.46]that was in the paper last night.
[11:05.61]M: Well, could you tell me your name?
[11:08.71]W: Candida Foreset.
[11:10.91]M: Oh, yes. What exactly is it that interests you about the job?
[11:15.55]W: Well, I thought it was just right for me.
[11:19.15]M: Really? Um... Could you tell me a little about yourself?
[11:23.89]W: Yes. I'm 23. I've been working abroad.
[11:27.84]M: Where exactly have you been working?
[11:30.59]W: In Geneva.
[11:31.81]M: Oh, Geneva. And what were you doing there?
[11:35.10]W: Secretarial work. Previous to that,
[11:38.33]I was in university.
[11:41.26]M: Which university was that?
[11:43.22]W: The University of Manchester.
[11:45.32]I've got a degree in English.
[11:47.52]M: You said you've been working in Geneva.
[11:51.01]Do you have any special reason for wanting to come back?
[11:54.46]W: I thought it would be nice to be nearer to the family.
[11:57.70]M: I see, and how do you see yourself developing in this job?
[12:02.38]W: Well, I'm ambitious.
[12:04.30]I do hope that my career as a secretary
[12:06.74]will lead me eventually into management.
[12:09.89]M: I see. You have foreign languages?
[12:13.24]W: French and Italian.
[12:15.68]M: Well, I think the best thing for you to do
[12:19.06]is to reply in writing to the advertisement.
[12:21.96]W: Can't I arrange for an interview now?
[12:24.17]M: Well, I'm afraid we must wait until all the applications are in,
[12:29.56]in writing, and we'll then decide on the short list.
[12:33.06]If you are on the short list, of course we should see you.
[12:36.80]W: Oh, I see.
[12:38.24]M: I'll look forward to receiving your application
[12:41.68]in writing in a day or two.
[12:43.44]W: Oh, yes, yes, certainly.
[12:45.97]M: OK, thank you very much. Goodbye.
[12:48.57]W: Thank you. Goodbye.
[12:51.67]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:57.60]12. How did the woman get to know about the job vacancy?
[13:18.67]13. Why did the woman find the job appealing?
[13:38.94]14. What had the woman been doing in Geneva?
[13:59.04]15. What was the woman asked to do in the end?
[14:18.59]Section C
[14:20.41]Directions: In this section,
[14:23.26]you will hear three passages.
[14:25.21]At the end of each passage,
[14:27.40]you will hear three or four questions.
[14:30.70]Both the passage and the questions
[14:33.04]will be spoken only once.
[14:35.68]After you hear a question,
[14:37.58]you must choose the best answer
[14:40.28]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:45.19]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:49.43]with a single line through the centre.
[14:52.92]Passage One
[14:56.07]One of the greatest heartbreaks for firefighters occurs
[14:59.72]when they fail to rescue a child from a burning building
[15:02.67]because the child, frightened by smoke and noise,
[15:06.69]hides under a bed or in a closet and is later found dead.
[15:11.92]Saddest of all is when children catch a glimpse
[15:15.50]of the masked the firefighter but hide
[15:18.66]because they think they have seen a monster.
[15:21.06]To prevent such tragedies,
[15:24.19]firefighter Eric Velez gives talks to children in his community,
[15:29.68]explaining that they should never hide during a fire.
[15:33.79]He displays firefighters' equipment, including the oxygen mask,
[15:38.83]which he encourages his listeners to play with and put on.
[15:43.51]"If you see us," Velez tells them,
[15:46.36]"don't hide! We are not monsters.
[15:50.05]We have come to rescue you."
[15:52.79]Velez gives his presentations in English and Spanish.
[15:57.44]Growing up in San Francisco,
[16:00.18]he learned Spanish from his immigrant parents.
[16:03.98]Velez and other firefighters throughout North America,
[16:08.21]who give similar presentations,
[16:10.11]will never know how many lives they save through their talks.
[16:14.93]But it's a fact that informative speaking saves lives.
[16:19.87]For example, several months after listening to an informative speech,
[16:25.33]Pete Gentry in North Carolina rescued his brother
[16:29.43]who is choking on food,
[16:31.99]by using the method taught by student speaker,
[16:35.44]Julie Paris. In addition to saving lives,
[16:39.17]informative speakers help people learn new skills,
[16:43.86]solve problems and acquire fascinating facts
[16:47.80]about the exciting world in which they live.
[16:52.29]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:58.07]16. Why do some children trapped in a burning building
[17:02.91]hide from masked firefighters?
[17:20.79]17. What does the passage tell us about firefighter Eric Velez?
[17:43.28]18. What do we learn about Pete Gentry?
[18:03.41]19. What message is the speaker trying to convey?
[18:24.04]Passage Two
[18:25.99]Some people want to make and save a lot of money
[18:30.27]in order to retire early.
[18:32.42]I see people pursuing higher paying
[18:35.92]and increasingly demanding careers to accomplish this goal.
[18:40.21]They make many personal sacrifices in exchange for income today.
[18:46.24]The problem is that tomorrow might not come.
[18:50.88]Even if it all goes according to plan,
[18:53.94]will you know how to be happy when you are not working
[18:56.89]if you spend your entire life making money?
[19:00.10]More importantly,
[19:02.31]who will be around for you to share your leisure time with?
[19:05.96]At the other extreme are people who live only for today.
[19:09.95]"Why bother saving when I might not be here tomorrow?" they argue.
[19:14.20]The danger of this approach is that tomorrow may come after all.
[19:19.64]And most people don't want to spend all their tomorrows
[19:23.40]working for a living. The earlier neglect of saving,
[19:27.69]however, makes it difficult not to work when you are older.
[19:31.84]You may be surprised to hear me say
[19:35.13]that if you must pick an extreme
[19:37.54]I think it's better to pick the spend-all approach.
[19:40.93]As long as you don't mind continuing to work,
[19:44.68]assuming your health allows, you should be OK.
[19:48.77]At least, you are making use of your money,
[19:51.42]and hopefully deriving value and pleasure from it.
[19:55.52]Postponing doing what you love and being with people
[19:59.75]you love until retirement can be a mistake.
[20:02.96]It may never come.
[20:05.07]Retirement can be a great time for some people.
[20:08.86]For others, it is a time of boredom, loneliness and poor health.
[20:15.40]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:22.14]20. Why do some people pursue higher paying but demanding careers?
[20:43.79]21. What is the danger facing people who live only for today?
[21:06.52]22. What does the speaker seem to advocate?
[21:26.30]Passage Three
[21:27.91]Imagine that someone in your neighborhood broke the law,
[21:32.84]and the judge put the whole neighborhood under suspicion.
[21:37.33]How fair would that be?
[21:39.63]Well, it happens every day to high-schoolers.
[21:44.13]Just because some students have stolen things in shops,
[21:48.02]all of us are treated like thieves. Even though I'd never steal.
[21:53.76]Store employees looked at me like
[21:55.90]I'm some kind of hardened criminal.
[21:58.83]For example, during one lunch period,
[22:02.67]my friend Denny and I went to the Grab and Go Restaurant
[22:06.60]to have a hotdog.
[22:08.51]We arrived to find a line of students waiting outside.
[22:12.45]A new sign in the window told the story.
[22:16.65]"No more than two students at a time".
[22:20.54]After 15 minutes, we finally got in.
[22:24.87]But the store manager laid the evil eye on us.
[22:28.56]I asked him about the new sign, and he said,
[22:32.50]"You kids are stealing too much stuff." You kids?
[22:37.74]Too much stuff? We were not only assumed to be thieves,
[22:43.26]but brilliant, greedy thieves. The most annoying thing though,
[22:48.56]is the way employees watched my friends and me.
[22:51.87]It's horrible. Once, at a drugstore,
[22:56.48]I was looking around and found a guy standing on a large box,
[23:00.80]stocking the shelves. He was watching my hands,
[23:04.84]more than he was watching his own.
[23:07.49]I showed him that my hands were empty.
[23:10.38]He got down off his box and rushed off,
[23:13.66]as if he was going to get the store manager.
[23:17.01]How crazy is that!
[23:20.20]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[23:27.30]23. What does the speaker find to be unfair?
[23:47.93]24. What measure did the Grab and Go Restaurant take to stop stealing?
[24:09.96]25. What happened in a drugstore that greatly annoyed the speaker?
[24:31.89]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

[00:19.09]Part II  Listening Comprehension
[00:22.04]Section A
[00:23.61]Directions: In this section,
[00:25.96]you will hear three news reports.
[00:28.34]At the end of each news report,
[00:30.42]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:33.85]Both the news report and the questions
[00:36.10]will be spoken only once.
[00:38.92]After you hear a question,
[00:40.49]you must choose the best answer
[00:42.23]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:47.52]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:51.25]with a single line through the centre.
[00:55.00]News Report One
[00:56.83]A 16th century castle in Scotland is close to collapsing
[01:01.45]after lumps of soil were washed away by floods,
[01:05.04]threatening its foundations.
[01:08.01]On Sunday, the castle's owner John Gordon, 76,
[01:11.73]was forced to move out of his property
[01:14.70]after the River Dee swept away about 60 feet of land,
[01:18.95]leaving the castle dangerously close to the river,
[01:22.10]according to the Scottish Daily Record.
[01:25.25]Abergeldie castle,
[01:26.52]located in Aberdeenshire, Scotland,
[01:29.27]was built by Sir Alexander Gordon of Midmar
[01:32.65]who later became the Earl of Huntly.
[01:35.81]The castle, which is located on 11,700 acres,
[01:40.80]was leased to members of the royal family
[01:43.69]between 1848 and 1970,
[01:45.56]including King Edward VII and George V.
[01:51.47]The Scottish Environment Protection Agency
[01:54.56]has issued more than 35 flood warnings covering several regions,
[01:59.29]as Scotland continues to clean up
[02:02.63]after Storm Frank hit the country last Wednesday.
[02:06.55]"This means that rivers will rise more slowly,
[02:09.37]but then stay high for much longer," the environmental agency said.
[02:14.73]Question 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[02:20.24]1. Why did John Gordon move out of Abergeldie castle?
[02:38.87]2. What happened in Scotland last Wednesday?
[02:56.94]News Report Two
[02:59.12]Rescue efforts were underway Thursday morning for 17 miners
[03:03.38]who were stuck in an elevator below ground
[03:06.10]at Cargill rock salt mine near Lansing, New York,
[03:09.86]according to Marcia Lynch, public information officer
[03:13.29]with Tompkins County's emergency response department.
[03:17.59]Emergency workers have made contact with the miners
[03:20.75]via a radio,
[03:22.14]and they all appear to be uninjured,
[03:24.48]said Jessica Verfuss,
[03:26.83]the emergency department's assistant director.
[03:30.72]Crews have managed to provide heat packs and blankets
[03:33.62]to the miners so that they can keep warm
[03:36.48]during the rescue operation, Verfuss said.
[03:40.05]Details about what led to the workers' being trapped in the elevator
[03:43.89]weren't immediately available.
[03:46.27]The mine, along New York's Cayuga Lake,
[03:49.70]processes salt used for road treatment.
[03:52.73]It produces about 2 million tons of salt
[03:56.08]that is shipped to more than 1,500 places
[03:59.44]in the northeastern United States.
[04:02.08]The rock salt mine is one of three operated by Cargill
[04:05.75]with the other two in Louisiana and Ohio.
[04:10.03]Question 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[04:16.78]3. What does the news report say about the salt miners?
[04:36.02]4. What did the rescue team do?
[04:53.79]News Report Three
[04:55.64]The U.S. Postal Service announced today
[04:58.21]that it is considering closing about 3,700 post offices
[05:03.68]over the next year because of falling revenues.
[05:07.91]Facing an $8.3 billion budget deficit this year,
[05:12.63]closing post offices is one of several proposals
[05:15.96]the Postal Service has put forth recently to cut costs.
[05:20.62]Last week, for example,
[05:22.50]Postmaster General Pat Donahoe announced plans
[05:26.26]to stop mail delivery on Saturdays,
[05:29.11]a move he says could save $3 billion annually.
[05:33.14]"We are losing revenue as we speak," Donahoe said.
[05:36.79]"We do not want taxpayer money.
[05:38.85]We want to be self-sufficient.
[05:41.06]So like any other business you have to make choices."
[05:45.10]Dean Granholm,
[05:46.50]the vice president for delivery and post office operations,
[05:50.43]said the first wave of closings would begin this fall.
[05:54.48]He estimated that about 3,000 postmasters, 500 station managers
[06:00.14]and between 500 and 1,000 postal clerks could lose their jobs.
[06:06.00]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[06:11.29]5. What is the U.S. Postal Service planning to do?
[06:29.39]6. What measure has been planned to save costs?
[06:47.56]7. What will happen
[06:50.85]when the proposed measure comes into effect?
[07:06.03]Section B
[07:07.42]Directions: In this section,
[07:10.25]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:13.70]At the end of each conversation,
[07:16.15]you will hear four questions.
[07:19.02]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:21.82]will be spoken only once.
[07:24.04]After you hear a question,
[07:26.06]you must choose the best answer
[07:28.35]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:33.95]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:36.58]with a single line through the centre.
[07:41.43]Conversation One
[07:43.20]M: Mrs. Hampton,
[07:45.16]we've got trouble in the press room this morning.
[07:48.02]W: Oh dear. What about?
[07:48.86]M: One of the press operators arrived an hour and a half late.
[07:51.51]W: But that's a straightforward affair.
[07:53.64]He will simply lose part of his pay.
[07:55.95]That's why we have a clock-in system.
[07:58.84]M: But the point is the man was clocked-in at 8 o'clock.
[08:02.34]We have John standing by the time clock,
[08:04.46]and he swears he saw nothing irregular.
[08:06.99]W: Is John reliable?
[08:08.60]M: Yes, he is.
[08:09.86]That's why we chose him for the job.
[08:11.99]W: Have you spoken to the man who was late?
[08:14.46]M: Not yet.
[08:15.45]I thought I'd have a word with you first.
[08:17.91]He's a difficult man,
[08:19.19]and I think there's been some trouble on the shop floor.
[08:22.97]I've got a feeling that trade union representative is behind this.
[08:26.09]The manager told me
[08:27.32]that Jack Green's been very active around the shop
[08:29.89]the last few days.
[08:31.65]W: Well, what do you want me to do?
[08:33.91]M: I was wondering if you'd see Smith,
[08:35.94]the man who was late,
[08:37.12]because you are so much better at handling things like this.
[08:39.78]W: Oh, all right. I'll see him.
[08:41.80]I must say I agree with you
[08:44.32]about there being bad feelings in the works.
[08:47.24]I've had the idea for some time
[08:49.50]that Jack Green's been busy stirring things up
[08:52.70]in connection with the latest wage claim.
[08:55.88]He's always trying to make trouble.
[08:57.82]Well, I'll get the manager to send Smith up here.
[09:01.32]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:05.92]8. What will happen to the press operator
[09:09.53]who was late for work according to the woman?
[09:26.64]9. What does the man say about John
[09:29.62]who stands by the time clock?
[09:46.16]10. Why does the man suggest the woman see the worker
[09:50.17]who was late?
[10:05.63]11. What does the woman say about Jack Green?
[10:24.44]Conversation Two
[10:26.93]W: Our topic today is about something
[10:30.57]that foreigners nearly always say when they visit Britain.
[10:33.62]It's "Why are the British so cold?"
[10:36.45]And they're talking about the British personality
[10:39.86]--- the famous British "reserve".
[10:42.11]It means that we aren't very friendly,
[10:44.36]we aren't very open.
[10:46.14]M: So do you think it's true?
[10:48.05]W: It's a difficult one.
[10:49.89]So many people who visit Britain say
[10:52.61]it's difficult to make friends with British people.
[10:56.42]They say we're cold, reserved, unfriendly...
[10:59.82]M: I think it's true.
[11:01.24]Look at Americans or Australians.
[11:03.51]They speak the same language,
[11:05.36]but they're much more open.
[11:06.74]And you see it when you travel,
[11:08.35]people --- I mean strangers ---
[11:10.38]speak to you on the street or on the train.
[11:13.01]British people seldom speak on the train.
[11:15.67]Or the bus.
[11:17.12]Not in London, anyway.
[11:18.83]W: "Not in London." That's it.
[11:21.21]Capital cities are full of tourists and are never friendly.
[11:25.39]People are different in other parts of the country.
[11:28.07]M: Not completely.
[11:29.82]I met a woman once, an Italian.
[11:32.22]She's been working in Manchester for two years,
[11:34.78]and no one --- not one of her colleagues ---
[11:37.43]had ever invited her to their home.
[11:39.95]They were friendly to her at work,
[11:41.83]but nothing else.
[11:43.40]She couldn't believe it.
[11:45.33]She said that would never happen in Italy.
[11:48.13]W: You know what they say
[11:49.78]--- "an Englishman's home is his castle".
[11:52.73]It's really difficult to get inside.
[11:55.10]M: Yeah. It's about being private.
[11:57.49]You go home to your house and your garden
[11:59.59]and you close the door.
[12:00.91]It's your place.
[12:02.39]W: That's why the British don't like flats.
[12:04.67]They prefer to live in houses.
[12:06.78]M: That's true.
[12:08.98]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:13.74]12. What do foreigners generally think of British people
[12:18.14]according to the woman?
[12:34.19]13. What may British people typically do on a train
[12:38.89]according to the man?
[12:54.78]14. What does the man say about the Italian woman
[12:59.03]working in Manchester?
[13:15.11]15. Why do British people prefer houses to flats?
[13:34.49]Section C
[13:37.26]Directions: In this section,
[13:38.69]you will hear three passages.
[13:40.85]At the end of each passage,
[13:42.89]you will hear three or four questions.
[13:46.00]Both the passage and the questions
[13:48.76]will be spoken only once.
[13:51.28]After you hear a question,
[13:53.24]you must choose the best answer
[13:55.82]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:01.13]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:05.03]with a single line through the centre.
[14:09.25]Passage One
[14:10.83]In college, time is scarce,
[14:13.07]and consequently, very precious.
[14:15.86]At the same time,
[14:17.05]expenses in college pile up surprisingly quickly.
[14:21.24]A part-time job is a good way to balance costs
[14:24.70]while ensuring there is enough time left over
[14:27.35]for both academic subjects and after-class activities.
[14:32.61]If you are a college student looking for a part-time job,
[14:35.86]the best place to start your job search is right on campus.
[14:40.46]There are tons of on-campus job opportunities,
[14:43.74]and as a student,
[14:44.88]you'll automatically be given hiring priority.
[14:48.87]Plus, on-campus jobs eliminate commuting time,
[14:52.84]and could be a great way to connect with academic
[14:55.92]and professional resources at your university.
[15:00.07]Check with your school's careers service
[15:02.39]or employment office for help to find a campus job.
[15:06.84]Of course,
[15:07.64]there are opportunities for part-time work off-campus, too.
[15:12.30]If you spend a little time digging for the right part-time jobs,
[15:16.51]you'll save yourself time
[15:18.16]when you find a job that leaves you with enough time
[15:20.96]to get your school work done, too.
[15:23.58]If you are a college student looking for work
[15:26.77]but worry you won't have enough time
[15:28.55]to devote to academic subjects,
[15:30.69]consider working as a study hall or library monitor.
[15:35.17]Responsibilities generally include supervising study spaces
[15:38.61]to ensure that a quiet atmosphere is maintained.
[15:43.17]It's a pretty easy job,
[15:44.72]but one with lots of downtime
[15:46.96]--- which means you'll have plenty of time to catch up on reading,
[15:50.38]do homework or study for an exam.
[15:55.89]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:01.02]16. What does the speaker say about college students
[16:06.04]applying for on-campus jobs?
[16:22.82]17. What can students do to find a campus job
[16:27.58]according to the speaker?
[16:43.04]18. What does the speaker say
[16:46.14]is a library monitor's responsibility?
[17:03.24]Passage Two
[17:06.03]Agricultural workers in green tea fields
[17:08.58]near Mt. Kenya are gathering the tea leaves.
[17:12.22]It is beautiful to see.
[17:14.16]The rows of tea bushes are straight.
[17:16.73]All appears to be well.
[17:18.80]But the farmers who planted the bushes are worried.
[17:22.30]Nelson Kibara is one of them.
[17:24.61]He has been growing tea in the Kerugoya area for 40 years.
[17:29.42]He says the prices this year have been so low
[17:32.73]that he has made almost no profit.
[17:35.72]He says he must grow different kinds of tea
[17:38.86]if he is to survive.
[17:40.99]Mr. Kibara and hundreds of other farmers
[17:43.96]have been removing some of their tea bushes
[17:46.62]and planting a new kind of tea
[17:49.08]developed by the Tea Research Foundation of Kenya.
[17:53.26]Its leaves are purple and brown.
[17:56.01]When the tea is boiled,
[17:57.60]the drink has a purple color.
[18:00.79]Medical researchers have studied the health benefits of the new tea.
[18:05.28]They say it is healthier than green tea
[18:08.05]and could be sold for a price
[18:10.34]that is three to four times higher than the price of green tea.
[18:15.22]But Mr. Kibara says he has not received a higher price
[18:19.42]for his purple tea crop.
[18:20.93]He says the market for the tea is unstable
[18:24.27]and he is often forced to sell his purple tea
[18:27.52]for the same price as green tea leaves.
[18:30.63]He says there are not enough buyers
[18:33.51]willing to pay more for the purple tea.
[18:39.16]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[18:42.48]19. Why have tea farmers in Kenya decided to grow purple tea?
[19:02.87]20. What do researchers say about purple tea?
[19:24.50]21. What has Mr. Kibara found about purple tea?
[19:42.08]Passage Three
[19:44.35]Today's consumers want beautiful handcrafted objects to wear
[19:48.60]and to have for their home environment.
[19:51.48]They prefer something unique and they demand quality.
[19:55.83]Craftsmen today are meeting this demand.
[19:59.34]People and homes are showing great change
[20:02.17]as more and more unique handcrafted items become available.
[20:05.41]Handicrafts are big business.
[20:09.98]No longer does a good craftsman have to work in a job
[20:13.36]he dislikes all day and then try to create at night.
[20:17.45]He has earned his professional status.
[20:20.20]He is now a respected member of society.
[20:23.93]Parts of the fun of being a craftsman is meeting other craftsmen.
[20:28.65]They love to share their ideas and materials
[20:31.83]and help others find markets for their work.
[20:35.40]Craftsmen have helped educate consumers to make wise choices.
[20:40.37]They help them become aware of design and technique.
[20:44.84]They help them relate their choice to its intended use.
[20:48.75]They often involve consumers in trying the craft themselves.
[20:53.17]When a group of craftsmen expands to include more members,
[20:56.50]a small craft organization is formed.
[20:59.75]Such an organization does a lot in training workshops
[21:02.94]in special media,
[21:04.55]craft marketing techniques, craft fairs and sales, festivals,
[21:09.10]TV appearances and demonstrations.
[21:12.52]State art councils help sponsor local arts and crafts festivals
[21:17.17]which draw crowds of tourist consumers.
[21:20.56]This boosts the local economy considerably
[21:23.36]because tourists not only buy crafts,
[21:26.34]but they also use the restaurants and hotels
[21:29.30]and other services of the area.
[21:33.34]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[21:40.06]22. What does the speaker say about today's consumers?
[21:59.65]23. What does the speaker say about good craftsmen in the past?
[22:20.09]24. What do craftsmen help consumers do?
[22:38.32]25. Why do state art councils help sponsor local arts
[22:43.99]and crafts festivals?
[22:59.87]This is the end of Listening Comprehension.

[00:22.30]Section A
[00:23.71]Directions:
[00:25.12]In this section,
[00:26.19]you will hear three news reports.
[00:28.83]At the end of each news report,
[00:30.90]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:34.29]Both the news report and the questions
[00:36.63]will be spoken only once.
[00:39.39]After you hear a question,
[00:41.11]you must choose the best answer
[00:42.73]from the four choices
[00:44.21]marked A), B), C) and D).
[00:47.99]Then mark the corresponding letter
[00:49.99]on Answer Sheet 1
[00:51.77]with a single line through the centre.
[00:54.83]News Report One
[00:56.77]New York State plans
[00:58.24]to shut off the thundering waters
[01:00.31]of Niagara Falls—again.
[01:02.81]At least,
[01:03.92]the American side of the falls.
[01:06.35]This "once in a lifetime" event
[01:08.99]actually may take place twice
[01:11.08]in some folks' lives.
[01:12.81]The New York State parks system
[01:14.86]wants to turn off the falls
[01:16.96]on the American side
[01:18.52]sometime in the next two to three years
[01:22.00]to replace two 115-year-old stone bridges
[01:26.99]that allow pedestrians, park vehicles
[01:29.98]and utilities access to Goat Island.
[01:33.59]The American side of the falls
[01:35.96]were shut off in 1969
[01:38.89]to study the buildup of rock
[01:41.09]at the base of the falls.
[01:43.47]When that happened,
[01:44.95]people came from all over the world
[01:47.52]to see the falls turned off.
[01:50.26]People are curious by nature.
[01:52.83]They want to see
[01:53.92]what's underneath.
[01:55.29]In fact,
[01:56.35]those who first came
[01:57.83]to have a look
[01:59.02]did see something.
[02:00.99]They found millions of coins
[02:02.81]on the bottom.
[02:04.63]Questions 1 and 2
[02:06.31]are based on the news report
[02:07.92]you have just heard.
[02:09.95]1. Why does New York State
[02:13.06]want to turn off Niagara Falls?
[02:30.58]2. What did people find
[02:33.41]when Niagara Falls were shut off
[02:35.37]in 1969?
[02:51.95]News Report Two
[02:53.74]The Tunisian government
[02:54.97]said Monday
[02:56.20]that 45 people have been killed
[02:58.67]after gunmen attacked a town
[03:00.76]near the border with Libya.
[03:02.93]The Interior and Defense ministries
[03:05.13]said that the Tunisian government
[03:07.26]has closed its two border crossings
[03:09.70]with Libya
[03:10.54]because of the attack.
[03:12.60]The Tunisian military
[03:13.95]has sent reinforcements
[03:15.39]and helicopters to the area,
[03:17.97]and authorities
[03:19.07]have been hunting several attackers
[03:21.13]who were still at large.
[03:23.23]The violence came
[03:24.21]amid increasing international concern
[03:26.80]about Islamic State extremists in Libya.
[03:30.74]Officials of the Tunisian government
[03:32.86]are especially worried
[03:34.31]after dozens of tourists were killed
[03:36.41]in the attacks in Tunisia last year.
[03:39.36]Defense Minister Farhat Horchani
[03:41.57]said last week
[03:42.64]that German and American security experts
[03:45.61]were expected to come to help Tunisia
[03:48.11]devise a new
[03:49.08]electronic video supervision system
[03:51.72]on its border with Libya.
[03:54.22]Tunisia was targeted last year
[03:55.92]by three attacks
[03:57.24]that left 70 people dead
[03:59.29]and were claimed by Islamic State.
[04:03.24]Questions 3 and 4
[04:05.33]are based on the news report
[04:07.17]you have just heard.
[04:09.77]3. What did the Tunisian government do
[04:14.06]after the gunmen's attack?
[04:31.23]4. What were German
[04:33.45]and American security experts
[04:35.83]expected to do in Tunisia?
[04:53.02]News Report Three
[04:55.49]Three university students
[04:57.20]in Santiago, Chile,
[04:58.99]have developed a plant-powered device
[05:01.86]to charge their mobile phones.
[05:04.42]The three engineering students
[05:06.40]got the idea for the device
[05:08.77]while sitting in their school's courtyard.
[05:11.93]Their invention
[05:13.15]is a small biological circuit
[05:15.85]they call E-Kaia.
[05:17.77]It captures the energy
[05:19.57]which plants produce
[05:20.90]during photosynthesis—
[05:22.67]a process of converting sunlight
[05:25.09]into energy.
[05:26.84]A plant uses only
[05:28.46]a small part of the energy
[05:30.75]produced by that process.
[05:33.05]The rest goes into the soil.
[05:35.72]E-Kaia collects that energy.
[05:38.67]The device plugs into the ground
[05:41.09]and then into a mobile phone.
[05:44.74]The E-Kaia solved two problems
[05:47.52]for the engineering students.
[05:49.63]They needed an idea for a class project.
[05:53.02]They also needed an outlet
[05:54.86]to plug in their phones.
[05:57.52]One of the student inventors,
[05:59.42]Camila Rupcich,
[06:00.85]says the device changes the energy
[06:03.29]released from the plant
[06:05.26]into low-level power to charge phones.
[06:09.13]The E-Kaia is able to fully recharge
[06:12.52]a mobile phone
[06:13.77]in less than two hours.
[06:16.78]Questions 5 to 7
[06:18.15]are based on the news report
[06:19.63]you have just heard.
[06:21.67]5. What did the three university students
[06:25.44]invent?
[06:41.49]6. When did they get the idea
[06:44.46]for the invention?
[07:00.65]7. What does the speaker say
[07:03.95]about the invention?
[07:20.32]Section B
[07:21.67]Directions:
[07:23.16]In this section,
[07:24.59]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:28.11]At the end of each conversation,
[07:30.50]you will hear four questions.
[07:33.63]Both the conversation and the questions
[07:36.11]will be spoken only once.
[07:38.64]After you hear a question,
[07:40.56]you must choose the best answer
[07:42.66]from the four choices
[07:44.48]marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:48.33]Then mark the corresponding letter
[07:50.38]on Answer Sheet 1
[07:52.29]with a single line through the centre.
[07:55.79]Conversation One
[07:57.47]M: Good morning.
[07:58.24]What can I do for you?
[07:59.47]W: Good morning.
[08:00.56]Could I talk to
[08:01.56]Jeffry Harding please?
[08:03.10]M: Speaking.
[08:03.95]W: Hello, Jeff.
[08:04.77]It's Helen.
[08:05.81]I got your message
[08:07.01]on the answering machine.
[08:08.31]What's the problem?
[08:09.38]M: Oh, Helen.
[08:10.77]Well,
[08:11.38]it's the Grimsby plant again,
[08:12.81]I'm afraid.
[08:13.92]The robots on Line 3 have gone wrong.
[08:16.21]And the line is at a standstill.
[08:18.15]W: Can't you replace them
[08:19.38]with the stand-ins?
[08:20.46]M: I'm afraid not.
[08:21.48]The stand-ins are already in use
[08:23.30]on Line 6.
[08:24.61]And the ones from Line 6
[08:25.73]are being serviced.
[08:27.15]W: When did this happen, Jeff?
[08:28.88]M: Well,
[08:29.52]they've been making
[08:30.29]a low continuous sound
[08:31.47]for a day or two.
[08:32.80]But they finally went dead
[08:33.97]at 2:30 this afternoon.
[08:35.81]W: I see.
[08:36.92]What did you do?
[08:38.39]Have you tried the whole plant?
[08:40.16]M: Not yet, Helen.
[08:41.32]I thought I'd better get your OK first.
[08:43.82]W: OK.
[08:44.96]Get on the phone to Tom,
[08:46.84]and try to get their stand-ins
[08:48.52]over tonight.
[08:49.90]We have to be back
[08:50.86]at full capacity tomorrow morning.
[08:53.45]Is it a major job
[08:54.63]to repair our robots?
[08:56.43]M: About a week.
[08:57.45]That's what the maintenance engineer says.
[08:59.65]W: Right.
[09:00.42]Well,
[09:01.17]if you can get the ones from Hall,
[09:03.08]please ask Tom
[09:04.27]to inform Sheffield
[09:05.38]that he may need their stand-ins
[09:07.47]in case of emergency
[09:09.29]during the next week.
[09:10.81]M: OK.
[09:11.63]Thank you very much, Helen.
[09:12.92]W: You are most welcome.
[09:14.15]M: Sorry to spoil your day off.
[09:15.84]W: It doesn't matter.
[09:18.07]Questions 8 to 11
[09:19.30]are based on the conversation
[09:20.71]you have just heard.
[09:22.80]8. What did the man do
[09:25.45]before the telephone conversation?
[09:42.78]9. What does the man say
[09:45.42]about line 3 in the Grimsby plant?
[10:03.10]10. What is the man's purpose
[10:06.08]in calling the woman?
[10:22.55]11. Where is the woman
[10:25.16]at the time of the conversation?
[10:42.08]Conversation Two
[10:43.75]W: This is Kerry Burke
[10:45.28]from New York Daily News.
[10:47.60]I'm speaking to Delroy Simmonds,
[10:50.06]an unemployed Brooklyn man
[10:51.99]who missed a job interview Tuesday
[10:54.49]for the best of reasons:
[10:56.61]He was saving the life
[10:57.81]of a 9-month-old boy
[11:00.08]who was blown into the path
[11:01.92]of an oncoming subway train
[11:04.02]by a high wind.
[11:05.93]M: Everybody is making me out
[11:07.08]to be some sort of superhero.
[11:09.31]I'm just an ordinary person,
[11:11.20]and a father of two.
[11:12.90]Anybody in that situation
[11:14.27]would have done what I did.
[11:16.41]W: You were going to an interview
[11:18.11]when the incident occurred, right?
[11:20.02]M: Yes,
[11:20.80]I was on my way
[11:21.55]to apply for a maintenance position.
[11:24.08]I've been looking for a job
[11:25.16]for a year and more.
[11:27.15]I'm looking for something
[11:27.96]to support my family.
[11:29.58]W: Tell us what happened
[11:31.06]at the station.
[11:32.23]M: There was a strong wind.
[11:33.79]It had to be 30 to 40 miles an hour.
[11:36.65]There was a woman with four kids.
[11:38.65]One was in a pushchair.
[11:40.47]The wind blew the baby onto the tracks.
[11:43.39]W: Witnesses said
[11:44.65]people were looking on in horror
[11:47.15]as the child's mother,
[11:48.45]identified by sources as Maria Zamara,
[11:51.52]stood frozen in shock.
[11:53.95]In the distance,
[11:55.04]people could see
[11:55.85]the train rounding a bend,
[11:57.65]headed into the station.
[11:59.56]I guess you were not aware
[12:01.01]of any of these, right?
[12:02.88]M: No.
[12:03.77]I just jumped down
[12:04.70]and grabbed the baby.
[12:06.11]The train was coming around the corner
[12:07.65]as I lifted the baby from the tracks.
[12:09.90]I really wasn't thinking.
[12:11.27]W: What an amazing story.
[12:13.38]Thank you very much.
[12:15.40]Questions 12 to 15
[12:16.85]are based on the conversation
[12:18.30]you have just heard.
[12:20.32]12. What did Kerry Burke
[12:23.37]from New York Daily News
[12:25.04]say about the man?
[12:41.92]13. What do we learn about the man
[12:44.92]from the conversation?
[13:02.04]14. What caused the incident?
[13:21.36]15. How did the mother react
[13:24.16]when the incident occurred?
[13:41.77]Section C
[13:43.23]Directions:
[13:44.72]In this section,
[13:46.03]you will hear three passages.
[13:48.51]At the end of each passage,
[13:50.27]you will hear three or four questions.
[13:53.77]Both the passage and the questions
[13:56.38]will be spoken only once.
[13:58.95]After you hear a question,
[14:00.83]you must choose the best answer
[14:03.15]from the four choices
[14:04.56]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:08.81]Then mark the corresponding letter
[14:10.83]on Answer Sheet 1
[14:12.81]with a single line through the centre.
[14:16.02]Passage One
[14:17.74]There's one sound
[14:18.74]that gets a big reaction from kids
[14:20.84]on a hot day,
[14:22.42]the sound of an ice-cream truck.
[14:25.07]Maria McCartney
[14:26.32]has been in the mobile ice-cream business
[14:28.77]since 2005.
[14:31.13]"When I was a little girl,
[14:32.62]I saw an ice-cream truck
[14:34.05]and knew I wanted to have one someday,"
[14:36.40]McCartney said.
[14:38.32]During the hot days of summer,
[14:40.24]Maria and her daughter
[14:41.83]drive an ice-cream truck
[14:43.11]through neighborhoods and parks
[14:45.03]in Billings.
[14:46.80]It's not about making money
[14:48.29]for this former elementary school teacher.
[14:50.95]Rather,
[14:51.86]she wants to preserve the tradition
[14:53.56]of the neighborhood ice-cream truck.
[14:56.22]"Truly my favorite part
[14:57.76]is to see the kids
[14:58.77]jumping up and down
[15:00.20]and they just get so excited.
[15:02.93]It's great
[15:03.47]to build a memory for them too.
[15:05.61]There's not
[15:05.99]a lot of these ice-cream trucks
[15:07.65]around anymore.
[15:09.13]The parents come out
[15:10.17]barefoot and screaming,
[15:11.77]ready to buy ice-cream;
[15:13.58]they remember when they were kids
[15:15.09]and they saw a truck,"
[15:16.47]she said.
[15:18.10]While the treats may be ice cold,
[15:20.53]Maria has a warm heart for little faces.
[15:23.83]Her truck features a donation bucket
[15:25.86]for kids who don't have money
[15:27.45]for ice-cream.
[15:29.49]"When there are three kids
[15:30.90]and only two of them have money,
[15:33.14]I always make sure
[15:34.15]the third one gets something
[15:35.97]because I can't drive away
[15:37.52]and have that third one
[15:38.56]not have something,"
[15:39.83]she said.
[15:41.72]Questions 16 to 18
[15:44.31]are based on the passage
[15:45.88]you have just heard.
[15:48.01]16. What does the speaker say
[15:51.52]about Maria McCartney?
[16:08.54]17. Why does Maria
[16:11.45]go into the mobile ice-cream business?
[16:29.74]18. Why does Maria
[16:32.13]put a donation bucket
[16:33.87]in her truck?
[16:49.99]Passage Two
[16:52.15]We know we have to pay
[16:53.67]for what we get.
[16:55.02]If we buy food,
[16:56.36]we have to pay for it.
[16:58.02]If a doctor treats us,
[16:59.58]we know
[17:00.22]there will be a bill to pay.
[17:02.56]These are private bills.
[17:04.36]But there are also public bills
[17:06.45]to be paid.
[17:07.81]They are paid by the government.
[17:09.70]In turn
[17:10.29]we get the needed services.
[17:12.27]We pay for these services
[17:13.70]through taxes.
[17:15.60]What would happen
[17:16.37]if everyone stopped paying taxes?
[17:19.57]The water supply would stop;
[17:21.82]the streets might not be cleaned;
[17:24.24]schools would be closed.
[17:26.50]We would not want to live
[17:27.83]in such a city.
[17:29.86]The chief duty of every government
[17:32.14]is to protect persons and property.
[17:35.05]More than three-fourths
[17:36.17]of government expenses
[17:38.20]are used for this purpose.
[17:40.65]The next largest amount of public money
[17:43.16]goes to teach and train our citizens.
[17:46.34]Billions of dollars each year
[17:48.49]are spent on schools and libraries.
[17:51.33]Also, a large amount of public funds
[17:53.70]is spent on roads.
[17:56.10]Most of the needed funds
[17:57.49]is raised by taxes.
[17:59.72]The law orders us to pay taxes.
[18:02.36]We have no choice in the matter.
[18:05.10]Years ago
[18:06.13]the government made money
[18:07.58]by selling public lands.
[18:09.83]But most of the best public lands
[18:11.95]have now been sold.
[18:13.81]There are still some public lands
[18:15.48]that contain oil, coal
[18:17.87]and other natural resources.
[18:20.17]They could be sold,
[18:21.69]but we want to save them
[18:23.02]for future years.
[18:24.91]So, we all must pay our share
[18:27.08]for the services
[18:27.95]that make our lives comfortable.
[18:30.62]Questions 19 to 21
[18:32.57]are based on the passage
[18:33.83]you have just heard.
[18:35.89]19. What does the speaker
[18:38.70]mainly talk about?
[18:55.51]20. What is most of the government money
[18:59.01]used for?
[19:15.59]21. How did the government raise money
[19:18.82]to pay public bills in the past?
[19:36.40]Passage Three
[19:38.46]Did you know that,
[19:39.45]besides larger places
[19:40.78]like France and Germany,
[19:42.40]Europe is home
[19:43.06]to several extremely tiny countries?
[19:45.47]One of these countries contains less
[19:47.31]than a square mile of land.
[19:49.45]Another is surrounded on all sides
[19:51.45]by Italy.
[19:52.99]Yet each is an independent land,
[19:55.52]with its own government, trade, and customs.
[19:58.95]One of the best known
[19:59.99]of these small countries
[20:01.26]is Monaco.
[20:02.72]It is situated on the Mediterranean Sea
[20:05.42]and surrounded by France
[20:06.77]on three sides.
[20:08.88]Monaco became familiar to Americans
[20:11.40]when its ruler, Prince Rainier,
[20:13.58]married the American actress Grace Kelly.
[20:16.73]Rainier's family
[20:17.85]has ruled Monaco
[20:19.30]almost continuously since 1297.
[20:23.50]The land has been independent
[20:25.16]for over three hundred years.
[20:27.90]Andorra,
[20:28.77]with an area of some 200 square miles,
[20:31.67]is considerably larger than Monaco.
[20:34.67]This country is located
[20:36.06]in the Pyrenees Mountains,
[20:38.11]with France on one side
[20:39.90]and Spain on the other.
[20:42.46]Potatoes and tobacco are grown
[20:44.84]in Andorra's steep mountain valleys.
[20:47.92]One of the products it exports
[20:49.49]is clothing.
[20:50.54]Andorra is also known
[20:51.90]for its excellent skiing locations.
[20:55.36]Within the Alps in Central Europe
[20:57.33]is Liechtenstein,
[20:58.83]a tiny country of about 30,000 people
[21:01.70]who speak mostly German.
[21:04.15]Liechtenstein uses the same money
[21:06.20]as its neighbor Switzerland,
[21:08.04]but it has been an independent country
[21:10.40]since the 1860s.
[21:12.77]Taxes are low,
[21:14.13]so many businesses
[21:15.22]have their headquarters here.
[21:17.36]The country makes and exports
[21:19.19]a lot of machinery.
[21:21.53]Other small, independent states in Europe
[21:24.21]are San Marino and Luxembourg.
[21:26.91]Each of these has unique qualities as well.
[21:31.05]Questions 22 to 25
[21:33.70]are based on the passage
[21:35.22]you have just heard.
[21:37.55]22. What does the speaker say
[21:41.16]about Monaco?
[21:57.99]23. Why did Monaco
[22:00.92]become familiar to Americans
[22:03.33]according to the speaker?
[22:19.96]24. What is one of the products
[22:23.79]Andorra exports?
[22:40.53]25. What does the speaker
[22:43.47]mainly talk about?
[22:59.95]This is the end
[23:00.86]of listening comprehension.

[00:54.85]News Report One
[00:58.32]An elderly Japanese woman has died
[01:01.60]while diving at the Great Barrier Reef,
[01:04.15]in the fourth tourist death at the Australian attraction in a month.
[01:08.80]The 75-year-old was pulled from the water on Tuesday at Moore Reef,
[01:15.19]about 45km (30 miles) from Cairns.
[01:19.61]The woman, who had been diving with a tour group,
[01:23.22]was given CPR but could not be revived.
[01:27.27]Diving deaths raise safety questions in Australia.
[01:31.32]It quoted the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators
[01:36.03]as saying that most of the victims were elderly
[01:39.31]and had pre-existing medical conditions.
[01:42.78]A spokesman said Wednesday
[01:44.98]they were considering regulation improvement
[01:47.96]following the latest incident involving the Japanese woman,
[01:52.16]such as making visitors over a certain age
[01:55.28]acknowledge the risks associated with diving.
[01:59.53]Questions 1 and 2 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[02:05.75]Question 1: What do we learn from the news report?
[02:26.61]Question 2: What measures might be taken to prevent diving death incidents?
[02:49.73]News Report Two
[02:51.81]A maternity unit has been ordered to improve security
[02:55.61]due to fears parents could "leave with the wrong baby".
[03:00.69]The Royal London Hospital has been told
[03:03.34]by the Care Quality Commission (CQC)
[03:07.34]that "lax" checking of name bands left babies and families at risk.
[03:13.15]A total of 4,645 babies were born at the Whitechapel hospital last year.
[03:21.85]Inspectors, who visited the hospital in July,
[03:25.27]also found there were not enough midwives on the delivery suite
[03:30.53]to provide safe cover for all women.
[03:33.70]Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the hospital,
[03:38.56]has been told to "urgently" improve security in maternity
[03:42.99]after rating the service "inadequate".
[03:46.70]The CQC report said some babies born at the hospital had no name tags---
[03:52.90]creating a "risk a baby might receive medication intended for another baby
[03:58.70]and mother might leave the unit with the wrong baby".
[04:04.55]Questions 3 and 4 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[04:09.46]Question 3: Why has a maternity unit been ordered to improve security?
[04:32.81]Question 4: What did the inspectors visiting the hospital in July find?
[04:56.15]News Report Three
[04:58.60]US national Joshua Samuel Aaron, 32,
[05:02.90]was held at New York's JFK airport
[05:06.86]and will appear in court on Thursday.
[05:09.46]He is one of three men accused of
[05:12.36]illegally accessing the personal information of 100 million people.
[05:18.68]Twelve major institutions were victims of the hacking, including JPMorgan.
[05:25.19]Until now Mr Aaron had been a fugitive living in Moscow.
[05:30.10]In a statement on Wednesday, US Attorney Preet Bharara said:
[05:35.95]"Joshua Samuel Aaron allegedly worked to hack into the networks
[05:41.61]of dozens of American companies,
[05:44.31]ultimately leading to the largest theft of personal information
[05:48.13]from US financial institutions ever."
[05:51.79]The other two suspects are Israeli men:
[05:55.23]Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein.
[05:58.71]They were arrested in Israel in July last year,
[06:02.56]and extradited to the US in June this year.
[06:06.71]All three men were charged in November last year.
[06:10.76]They allegedly manipulated stock prices
[06:14.11]by selling shares of companies to individuals
[06:17.51]whose contact information they had stolen.
[06:20.67]The men were also charged
[06:22.43]with running an illegal payment processing business
[06:26.19]that they used to collect 18 million dollars in fees.
[06:31.89]Questions 5 to 7 are based on the news report you have just heard.
[06:37.00]Question 5: What were the three men accused of?
[06:57.85]Question 6: Where were the other two suspects,
[07:02.22]Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, arrested?
[07:20.80]Question 7: How did the three men control stock prices?
[07:43.88]Section B
[07:45.43]Directions: In this section,
[07:48.58]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:51.48]At the end of each conversation,
[07:54.19]you will hear four questions.
[07:56.99]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[08:02.31]After you hear a question,
[08:04.37]you must choose the best answer
[08:06.37]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[08:11.87]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[08:16.47]with a single line through the centre.
[08:20.27]Conversation One
[08:22.87]W: What sort of hours do you work, Steve?
[08:25.94]M: Well,I have to work very long hours, about 11 hours a day.
[08:30.55]W: What time do you start?
[08:33.15]M: I work 9 to 3. Then I start again at 5:30 and work until 11.
[08:39.40]Six days a week. So I have to work very unsocial hours.
[08:44.51]W: And do you have to work at the weekend?
[08:47.36]M: Oh, yes, that's our busiest time. I get Wednesdays off.
[08:52.06]W: What are the things you have to do,
[08:54.48]and the things you don't have to do?
[08:57.13]M: Eh, I don't have to do the washing-up, so that's good.
[09:01.19]I have to wear white
[09:03.14]and I have to keep everything in the kitchen totally clean.
[09:06.56]W: What's hard about the job?
[09:09.51]M: You're standing up all the time.
[09:11.81]When we're busy, people get angry and sharp.
[09:15.61]But that's normal.
[09:17.21]W: How did you learn the profession?
[09:20.21]M: Well, I did a two-year course at college.
[09:23.21]In the first year, we had to learn the basics.
[09:26.38]And then we had to take exams.
[09:28.78]W: Was it easy to find a job?
[09:31.18]M: I wrote to about six hotels.
[09:33.98]And one of them gave me my first job.
[09:36.48]So I didn't have to wait too long.
[09:38.19]W: And what's the secret of being good at your job?
[09:42.59]M: Attention to detail. You have to love it.
[09:46.49]You have to show passion for it.
[09:48.89]W: And what are your plans for the future?
[09:52.05]M: I want to have my own place when the time is right.
[09:57.10]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[10:04.05]Question 8: What does the man say about his job?
[10:24.55]Question 9: What does the man think is the hardest part of his job?
[10:47.98]Question 10: Where did the man get his first job after graduation?
[11:10.23]Question 11: What does the man say is important to being good at his job?
[11:32.12]Conversation Two
[11:34.82]W: Now you've seen this table of figures
[11:37.73]about the pocket money children in Britain get?
[11:41.18]M: Yes. I thought it was quite interesting,
[11:44.59]but I don't quite understand the column entitled "Change".
[11:48.79]Can you explain what it means?
[11:51.44]W: Well, I think it means the change from the year before.
[11:56.09]I am not a mathematician,
[11:58.49]but I assume the rise from 72p to 90p is a rise of 25 percent.
[12:06.54]M: Oh, yes. I see. And the inflation rate is there for comparison.
[12:11.70]W: Yes.
[12:12.35]Why do you think the rise in pocket money
[12:15.34]is often higher than inflation?
[12:17.80]M: I am sorry I've no idea.
[12:20.20]Perhaps parents in Britain are too generous.
[12:23.51]W: Perhaps they are.
[12:25.16]But it looks as if children were not better off in 2001
[12:30.26]than they were in 2002.
[12:33.26]That's strange, isn't it?
[12:35.76]And they seem to have been better off in 2003 than they are now.
[12:41.11]I wonder why that is.
[12:43.06]M: Yes. I don't understand that at all.
[12:46.18]W: Anyway, if you had children,
[12:49.27]how much pocket money would you give them?
[12:52.18]M: I don't know. I think I'll probably give them 2 pounds a week.
[12:58.43]W: Would you? And what would you expect them to do with it?
[13:02.83]M: Well, out of that,
[13:04.53]they'd have to buy some small personal things,
[13:07.21]but I wouldn't expect them to save to buy their own socks, for example.
[13:11.16]W: Yes. By the way,
[13:13.67]do most children in your country get pocket money?
[13:17.27]M: Yeah, they do.
[13:19.62]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[13:26.18]Question 12: What is the table of figures about?
[13:47.64]Question 13: What do we learn from the conversation
[13:51.99]about British children's pocket money?
[14:10.49]Question 14: What does the man think of the British parents?
[14:31.46]Question 15: Supposing the man had children,
[14:36.36]what would he expect them to do with their pocket money?
[14:55.84]Section C
[14:57.09]Directions: In this section,
[14:59.11]you will hear three passages.
[15:00.96]At the end of each passage,
[15:02.87]you will hear three or four questions.
[15:05.52]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[15:10.27]After you hear a question,
[15:12.47]you must choose the best answer
[15:14.42]from the four choices marked A), B), C) and D).
[15:18.88]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[15:22.98]with a single line through the centre.
[15:26.69]Passage One
[15:27.89]As the new sales director for a national computer firm,
[15:32.44]Alex Gordon was looking forward to his first meeting
[15:36.09]with the company's district managers.
[15:38.24]Everyone arrived on time,
[15:40.89]and Alex's presentation went extremely well.
[15:44.49]He decided to end the meeting with the conversation
[15:48.34]about the importance of the district managers to the company's plans.
[15:53.15]"I believe we are going to continue to increase our share of the market,"
[15:58.72]he began, "because of the quality of the people in this room.
[16:03.17]The district manager is the key to the success
[16:07.29]of the sales representatives in his district.
[16:10.04]He sets the term for everyone else.
[16:13.29]If he has ambitious goals and is willing to put in long hours,
[16:17.59]everyone in his unit will follow his example."
[16:21.44]When Alex was finished, he received polite applause,
[16:26.90]but hardly the warm response he had hoped for.
[16:30.25]Later he spoke with one of the senior managers.
[16:34.88]"Things were going so well until the end,"
[16:38.48]Alex said disappointedly. "Obviously, I said the wrong thing."
[16:43.63]"Yes," the district manager replied.
[16:47.79]"Half of our managers are women.
[16:50.64]Most have worked their way up from sales representatives,
[16:54.85]and they are very proud of the role
[16:56.45]they've played in the company's growth.
[16:58.30]They don't care at all about political correctness.
[17:02.22]But they were definitely surprised and distressed
[17:05.22]to be referred to as 'he' in your speech."
[17:10.78]Questions 16 to 19 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[17:16.84]Question 16: Who did Alex Gordon speak to at the first meeting?
[17:38.95]Question 17: What did Alex want to emphasize at the end of his presentation?
[18:01.75]Question 18: What do we learn about the audience at the meeting?
[18:23.29]Question 19: Why did Alex fail to receive the warm response he had hoped for?
[18:45.31]Passage Two
[18:49.26]The way to complain is to act business-like and important.
[18:54.77]If your complaint is immediate,
[18:57.42]suppose you got the wrong order at a restaurant,
[19:00.77]make a polite but firm request to see the manager.
[19:06.02]When the manager comes, ask his or her name.
[19:10.12]And then state your problem and what you expect to have done about it.
[19:15.22]Be polite!
[19:16.87]Shouting or acting rude will get you nowhere.
[19:20.17]But also be firm in making your complaint.
[19:24.20]Besides, act important.
[19:28.74]This doesn't mean to put on airs and say
[19:32.04]"do you know who I am?"
[19:34.25]What it means is that people are often treated the way
[19:38.41]they expect to be treated.
[19:40.91]If you act like someone who expects a fair request to be granted,
[19:45.31]chances are it will be granted.
[19:48.36]The worst way to complain is over the telephone.
[19:52.61]You are speaking to a voice coming from someone you cannot see.
[19:57.66]So you can't tell how the person on the line is reacting.
[20:02.46]It is easy for that person to give you the run-around.
[20:06.66]Complaining in person or by letter is generally more effective.
[20:13.12]If your complaint doesn't require an immediate response,
[20:17.62]it often helps to complain by letter.
[20:21.07]If you have an appliance that doesn't work,
[20:23.64]send a letter to the store that sold it.
[20:27.09]Be business-like and stick to the point.
[20:30.35]Don't spend a paragraph on
[20:32.75]how your uncle Joe tried to fix the problem and couldn't.
[20:37.80]Questions 20 to 22 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:43.85]Question 20: What does the speaker suggest you do
[20:49.10]when you are not served properly at a restaurant?
[21:07.36]Question 21: Why does the speaker say the worst way
[21:12.21]to complain is over the telephone?
[21:30.53]Question 22: What should you do if you make a complaint by letter?
[21:51.91]Passage Three
[21:53.81]Barbara Sanders is a wife and the mother of two children, ages 2 and 4.
[22:01.01]Her husband, Tom, is an engineer and makes an excellent salary.
[22:07.51]Before Barbara had children,
[22:10.11]she worked as an architect for the government,
[22:12.91]designing government housing.
[22:15.26]She quit her job when she became pregnant,
[22:18.46]but is now interested in returning to work.
[22:22.13]She's been offered an excellent job with the government.
[22:25.48]Her husband feels it's unnecessary for her to work
[22:29.64]since the family does not need the added income.
[22:32.74]He also thinks that a woman should stay home with her children.
[22:37.49]If Barbara feels the need to do socially important work,
[22:41.71]he thinks that she should do volunteer work one or two days a week.
[22:46.11]Barbara, on the other hand,
[22:48.71]has missed the excitement of her profession
[22:51.07]and does not feel she would be satisfied doing volunteer work.
[22:55.72]She would also like to have her own income,
[22:58.28]so she does not have to ask her husband for money
[23:01.31]whenever she wants to buy something.
[23:03.61]She does not think
[23:05.16]it's necessary to stay home every day with the children
[23:08.26]and she knows a very reliable baby-sitter
[23:11.42]who's willing to come to her house.
[23:13.67]Tom does not think a baby-sitter can replace a mother
[23:17.52]and thinks it's a bad idea for the children
[23:20.43]to spend so much time with someone
[23:22.53]who's not part of the family.
[23:25.63]Questions 23 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[23:32.73]Question 23: What was Barbara's profession before she had children?
[23:55.25]Question 24: What does Barbara's husband suggest she do
[23:59.91] if she wants to work?
[24:17.02]Question 25: What does Tom think about hiring a baby-sitter?
[24:38.07]This is the end of listening comprehension.
